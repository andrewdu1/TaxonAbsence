# TaxonAbsence
 Data, R code, and Supplementary Text for Du et al. *Paranthropus* absence paper.
 Code includes (1) R functions & the absence model, (2) fitting the model to data, and (3) creating figures.
 Any code that relies on the use of raw databases (e.g., producing Figure 6) is not included.
 Code for the R Markdown supplementary document is included in the Supplementary Text folder.
 Because this document requires reading in data from (un)published databases, it will not knit for you, and I post it only for the sake of transparency for how the supplementary text was created.
