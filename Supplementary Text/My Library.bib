	abstract = {The Mauer mandible, holotype of Homo heidelbergensis, was found in 1907 in fluvial sands deposited by the Neckar River 10 km southeast of Heidelberg, Germany. The fossil is an important key to understanding early human occupation of Europe north of the Alps. Given the associated mammal fauna and the geological context, the find layer has been placed in the early Middle Pleistocene, but confirmatory chronometric evidence has hitherto been missing. Here we show that two independent techniques, the combined electron spin resonance/U-series method used with mammal teeth and infrared radiofluorescence applied to sand grains, date the type-site of Homo heidelbergensis at Mauer to 609 ± 40 ka. This result demonstrates that the mandible is the oldest hominin fossil reported to date from central and northern Europe and raises questions concerning the phyletic relationship of Homo heidelbergensis to more ancient populations documented from southern Europe and in Africa. We address the paleoanthropological significance of the Mauer jaw in light of this dating evidence.},

	abstract = {In a nonhierarchical world, where selection on organisms regulated all nonrandom evolutionary change, the traditional equation of selection (a cause of sorting) with sorting itself (differential birth and death among varying organisms within a population) would rarely lead to error, even though the phenomena are logically distinct (for sorting is a simple description of differential "success," and selection a causal process). But in a hierarchical world, with entities acting as evolutionary individuals (genes, organisms, and species among them) at several levels of ascending inclusion, sorting among entities at one level has a great range of potential causes. Direct selection upon entities themselves is but one possibility among many. This paper discusses why hierarchy demands that sorting and selection be disentangled. It then presents and illustrates an expanded taxonomy of sorting for a hierarchical world. For each of three levels (genes, organisms, and species), we show how sorting can arise from selection at the focal level itself, and as a consequence either of downward causation from processes acting on individuals at higher levels or upward causation from lower levels. We then discuss how hierarchy might illuminate a range of evolutionary questions based on both the logical structure of hierarchy and the historical pathways of its construction-for hierarchy is a property of nature, not only a conceptual scheme for organization.},

I explore further the hypothesis (Vrba 1994) that the same evolutionary event of growth prolongation, or time hypermorphosis, as it acts on characters with different ancestral growth profiles in the same body plan, can result in a major reorganization--or "shuffling"--of body proportions such that some characters become larger and others smaller, some hyperadult and others more juvenilized. I suggest that this hypothesis applies to major features of hominid evolution including hominine encephalization.},

	abstract = {The dominating view of evolution based on the fossil record is that established species remain more or less unaltered during their existence. Substantial evolution is on the other hand routinely reported for contemporary populations, and most quantitative traits show high potential for evolution. These contrasting observations on long- and short-time scales are often referred to as the paradox of stasis, which rests on the fundamental assumption that periods of morphological stasis in the fossil record represent minimal evolutionary change. Investigating 450 fossil time series, I demonstrate that the nonaccumulating morphological fluctuations during stasis travel similar distances in morphospace compared to lineages showing directional change. Hence, lineages showing stasis are commonly undergoing considerable amounts of evolution, but this evolution does not accumulate to produce large net evolutionary changes over time. Rates of evolutionary change across modes in the fossil record may be more homogenous than previously assumed and advocated, supporting the claim that substantial evolution is not exclusively or causally linked to the process of speciation. Instead of exemplifying minimal evolution, stasis likely represents information on the dynamics of the adaptive landscape on macroevolutionary time scales, including the persistence of adaptive zones and ecological niches over millions of years.},

Bioassays are used to find the optimal conditions for the production of parasites and strategies for application in the field. In some of these assays, proportions are measured and, often, these data have an inflated number of zeros. In this work, six models will be applied to data sets obtained from biological control assays for Diatraea saccharalis , a common pest in sugar cane production. A natural choice for modelling proportion data is the binomial model. The second model will be an overdispersed version of the binomial model, estimated by a quasi-likelihood method. This model was initially built to model overdispersion generated by individual variability in the probability of success. When interest is only in the positive proportion data, a model can be based on the truncated binomial distribution and in its overdispersed version. The last two models include the zero proportions and are based on a finite mixture model with the binomial distribution or its overdispersed version for the positive data. Here, we will present the models, discuss their estimation and compare the results.},

	abstract = {Inference of past and present global biodiversity requires enough global data to distinguish biological pattern from sampling artifact. Pertinently, many studies have exposed correlated relationships between richness and sampling in the fossil record, and methods to circumvent these biases have been proposed. Yet, these studies often ignore paleobiogeography, which is undeniably a critical component of ancient global diversity. Alarmingly, our global analysis of 481,613 marine fossils spread throughout the Phanerozoic reveals that where localities are and how intensively they have been sampled almost completely determines empirical spatial patterns of richness, suggesting no separation of biological pattern from sampling pattern. To overcome this, we analyze diversity using occurrence records drawn from two discrete paleolatitudinal bands which cover the bulk of the fossil data. After correcting the data for sampling bias, we find that these two bands have similar patterns of richness despite markedly different spatial coverage. Our findings suggest that i) long-term diversity trends result from large-scale tectonic evolution of the planet, ii) short-term diversity trends are region-specific, and iii) paleodiversity studies must constrain their analyses to well-sampled regions to uncover patterns not driven by sampling.},

	abstract = {It is well known that there is a strong relationship among the environment, selection, and extinction, but the underlying role of genetics and genetic constraints in contributing to extinction is less appreciated. Integration of characters may enhance survivability for species, providing that selective pressure is parallel with the patterns of morphological integration. However, we hypothesize that, if the direction of selection shifts, integration may also prevent populations from responding quickly enough to the new directions of selection. This would lead to the inability to find a successful adaptive solution, causing downward pressure on the population, and ultimately, extinction. We test this model with a computer simulation, using an adaptive landscape model. We generate populations of varying levels of multivariate integration and generate selection pressures to test the ability of the populations to respond to selection both parallel and orthogonal to the axis of maximum variation. In these simulations, more highly integrated populations survived longer when selection was in the direction of maximum variation. However, when selection was closer to orthogonal to the axis of maximum variation, extinction was more rapid in highly integrated populations. These results suggest that integration may play a strong role in both survivability and extinction. Tightly integrated populations are highly persistent when selection pressure is close to the axis of maximum variation, which is expected to frequently be the case since integration is likely often a product of selection. However, these highly integrated taxa are more susceptible to extinction when the direction of selection shifts, and is closer to orthogonal to the axis of maximum variation.},

	abstract = {Niche and neutral processes drive community assembly and metacommunity dynamics, but their relative importance might vary with the spatial scale. The contribution of niche processes is generally expected to increase with increasing spatial extent at a higher rate than that of neutral processes. However, the extent to what community composition is limited by dispersal (usually considered a neutral process) over increasing spatial scales might depend on the dispersal capacity of composing species. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the distribution and diversity of species known to have great powers of dispersal (hundreds of kilometres), we analysed the relative importance of niche processes and dispersal limitation in determining beta-diversity patterns of aquatic plants and cladocerans over regional (up to 300 km) and continental (up to 3300 km) scales. Both taxonomic groups were surveyed in five different European regions and presented extremely high levels of beta-diversity, both within and among regions. High beta-diversity was primarily explained by species replacement (turnover) rather than differences in species richness (i.e. nestedness). Abiotic and biotic variables were the main drivers of community composition. Within some regions, small-scale connectivity and the spatial configuration of sampled communities explained a significant, though smaller, fraction of compositional variation, particularly for aquatic plants. At continental scale (among regions), a significant fraction of compositional variation was explained by a combination of spatial effects (exclusive contribution of regions) and regionally-structured environmental variables. Our results suggest that, although dispersal limitation might affect species composition in some regions, aquatic plant and cladoceran communities are not generally limited by dispersal at the regional scale (up to 300 km). Species sorting mediated by environmental variation might explain the high species turnover of aquatic plants and cladocerans at regional scale, while biogeographic processes enhanced by dispersal limitation among regions might determine the composition of regional biotas.},

	abstract = {Factors controlling savanna woody vegetation structure vary at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and as a consequence, unraveling their combined effects has proven to be a classic challenge in savanna ecology. We used airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to map three-dimensional woody vegetation structure throughout four savanna watersheds, each contrasting in geologic substrate and climate, in Kruger National Park, South Africa. By comparison of the four watersheds, we found that geologic substrate had a stronger effect than climate in determining watershed-scale differences in vegetation structural properties, including cover, height and crown density. Generalized Linear Models were used to assess the spatial distribution of woody vegetation structural properties, including cover, height and crown density, in relation to mapped hydrologic, topographic and fire history traits. For each substrate and climate combination, models incorporating topography, hydrology and fire history explained up to 30\% of the remaining variation in woody canopy structure, but inclusion of a spatial autocovariate term further improved model performance. Both crown density and the cover of shorter woody canopies were determined more by unknown factors likely to be changing on smaller spatial scales, such as soil texture, herbivore abundance or fire behavior, than by our mapped regional-scale changes in topography and hydrology. We also detected patterns in spatial covariance at distances up to 50–450 m, depending on watershed and structural metric. Our results suggest that large-scale environmental factors play a smaller role than is often attributed to them in determining woody vegetation structure in southern African savannas. This highlights the need for more spatially-explicit, wide-area analyses using high resolution remote sensing techniques.},

	abstract = {Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {\textgreater}16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5–261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species’ invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

	abstract = {A plethora of different theories, models, and concepts make up the field of community ecology. Amid this vast body of work, is it possible to build one general theory of ecological communities? What other scientific areas might serve as a guiding framework? As it turns out, the core focus of community ecology―understanding patterns of diversity and composition of biological variants across space and time―is shared by evolutionary biology and its very coherent conceptual framework, population genetics theory. The Theory of Ecological Communities takes this as a starting point to pull together community ecology's various perspectives into a more unified whole.Mark Vellend builds a theory of ecological communities based on four overarching processes: selection among species, drift, dispersal, and speciation. These are analogues of the four central processes in population genetics theory―selection within species, drift, gene flow, and mutation―and together they subsume almost all of the many dozens of more specific models built to describe the dynamics of communities of interacting species. The result is a theory that allows the effects of many low-level processes, such as competition, facilitation, predation, disturbance, stress, succession, colonization, and local extinction to be understood as the underpinnings of high-level processes with widely applicable consequences for ecological communities.Reframing the numerous existing ideas in community ecology, The Theory of Ecological Communities provides a new way for thinking about biological composition and diversity.},

	abstract = {Aim  To test for non-random co-occurrence in 36 species of grassland birds using a new metric and the C-score. The analysis used presence–absence data of birds distributed among 305 sites (or landscapes) over a period of 35 years. This analysis departs from traditional analyses of species co-occurrence in its use of temporal data and of individual species’ probabilities of occurrence to derive analytically the expected co-occurrence between paired species. Location  Great Plains region, USA. Methods  Presence–absence data for the bird species were obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The analysis was restricted to species pairs whose geographic ranges overlapped. Each of 541 species pairs was classified as a positive, negative, or non-significant association depending on the mean difference between the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence over the 35-year time-span. Results  Of the 541 species pairs that were examined, 202 to 293 (37–54\%) were positively associated, depending on which of two null models was used. However, only a few species pairs ({\textless}5\%) were negatively associated. An additional 89 species pairs did not have overlapping ranges and hence represented de facto negative associations. The results from analyses based on C-scores generally agreed with the analyses based on the difference between observed and expected co-occurrence, although the latter analyses were slightly more powerful. Main conclusions  Grassland birds within the Great Plains region are primarily distributed among landscapes either independently or in conjunction with one another. Only a few species pairs exhibited repulsed or segregated distributions. This indicates that the shared preference for grassland habitat may be more important in producing coexistence than are negative species interactions in preventing it. The large number of non-significant associations may represent random associations and thereby indicate that the presence/absence of other grassland bird species may have little effect on whether a given focal species is also found within the landscape. In a broader context, the probability-based approach used in this study may be useful in future studies of species co-occurrence.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Numerous models for predicting species distribution have been developed for conservation purposes. Most of them make use of environmental data (e.g., climate, topography, land use) at a coarse grid resolution (often kilometres). Such approaches are useful for conservation policy issues including reserve-network selection. The efficiency of predictive models for species distribution is usually tested on the area for which they were developed. Although highly interesting from the point of view of conservation efficiency, transferability of such models to independent areas is still under debate. We tested the transferability of habitat-based predictive distribution models for two regionally threatened butterflies, the green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the grayling (Hipparchia semele), within and among three nature reserves in northeastern Belgium. We built predictive models based on spatially detailed maps of area-wide distribution and density of ecological resources. We used resources directly related to ecological functions (host plants, nectar sources, shelter, microclimate) rather than environmental surrogate variables. We obtained models that performed well with few resource variables. All models were transferable—although to different degrees—among the independent areas within the same broad geographical region. We argue that habitat models based on essential functional resources could transfer better in space than models that use indirect environmental variables. Because functional variables can easily be interpreted and even be directly affected by terrain managers, these models can be useful tools to guide species-adapted reserve management.},

Seven such examples from the last 46 million years are described for North America and Eurasia. In three of the seven turnover events, competition with replacement taxa may have driven the decline of formerly dominant taxa. In the remaining four this is less likely because inferred functional similarity was minimal during the interval of temporal overlap between clades. However, competition still may have been important in producing the rise-and-fall pattern through suppression of evolution within replacement taxa; as long as the large carnivore ecospace was filled, the radiation of new taxa into that ecospace was limited, only occurring after the extinction of the incumbents. The apparently inevitable decline of incumbent taxa may reflect the tendency for clades of large carnivorous mammals to produce more specialized species as they mature, leading to increased vulnerability to extinction when environments change.},

	abstract = {The Quaternary faunal evolution for the Indonesian Archipelago reflects the unique relationship of each island with SE Asian mainland. The recent sub faunas of Sundaland (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Java, and Bali) preserved broad connections with the SE Asian mainland during the latest glacial. They are all balanced and show many mainland components. Alternatively, Wallacea (Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands) has always been geographically isolated from the mainland. Wallacea faunas thus remain unbalanced (they lack large carnivores) and endemic. A significant turnover arrives throughout the region with pronounced global sea level recessions around 0.8Ma, during the transition from Early Pleistocene (EP) to the Middle Pleistocene (MP). By way of comparison, the palaeontological records of Japan and Taiwan also preserve this turnover, with EP–MP recessions bringing East Asian mainland immigrants. On Java, the earliest, Late Pliocene to early Pleistocene Satir fauna indicates island conditions. Java became connected to the SE Asian mainland towards the end of the early Pleistocene. Global cooling brought open woodlands on Java, an environment evidently preferred by Homo erectus in the Ci Saat fauna and Trinil H.K. fauna. As EP–MP sea level recessions created a wide corridor across the Sunda Shelf, Siwaliks and the SE Asian mainland terrestrial mammals invaded, as is seen in the Kedung Brubus fauna. The succeeding Ngandong fauna maintains an open woodland character but shows some endemism (Homo erectus and Stegodon trigonocephalus, among others, can be distinguished on a subspecies level). The Late Pleistocene marks the earliest known tropical rainforest, and the corresponding Punung fauna is of Chinese affinity (with Pongo, Hylobates, and Elephas maximus). Homo sapiens probably arrives at this point as well. The youngest fossil faunas known from Java are the still poorly known Cipeundeuy Fauna (ca. 30ka) and the Holocene faunas from Wajak and Sampung. While Sulawesi and Flores remained isolated throughout the Quaternary, only a limited number of terrestrial vertebrates arrived by crossing sea barriers. Endemic island faunas with pygmy elephantoids and giant tortoises were present during the Early Pleistocene. EP–MP sea level recessions allowed large to medium sized elephantoids to replace the dwarf species. Around the same time, Homo erectus appears on the island of Flores. Modern faunas eventually replaced the Middle Pleistocene island faunas, but the time frame has yet to be pinpointed. Sulawesi presents a unique case. Its current fauna holds no Walanae representatives. Apart from the phalangers, which must have come from the east. The ancestors of all other large Sulawesi land vertebrates, fossil and extant, reached the island by crossing the Sunda Sea. As the South Sulawesi fauna was stable until the Middle Pleistocene, this area must have constituted a separate palaeo-island. Some localized developments can be observed (e.g. shortening of the metapodials in Celebochoerus, increasing hypsodonty in Stegodon).},

Hierarchies are able to render complexity tractable, by homogenizing units into collectives and by ordering collectives in ranks of increasing inclusiveness. Hierarchies contrast with positional structures, such as phylogenetic trees, for in trees all positions are occupied by the same sort of entity—there are no ranked collectives—and positions are specified by the order of appearance or precedence of the entities. In hierarchies, interactions within ranks are most important; in trees, sequences of events along branches are of primary concern. As a result hierarchies do, and trees do not, display emergent properties.The value of the hierarchical structure can be lost when ranks are misspecified. A common error is the use of only a fraction of entities that actually occur in a rank, as when genes are considered as a rank below cells, disregarding the remaining cell contents and rendering the nature of cellular organization moot. Misspecification is also common when attributes or processes are used in ranks without indications of the physical entities to which they refer, thus losing track of the proper composition and ranking of the collectives.},

Here, we reconstruct the temporal accumulation of terrestrial bird species of the Galápagos using a novel phylogenetic method that estimates rates of biota assembly for an entire community. We show that species richness on the archipelago is in an ascending phase and does not tend towards equilibrium. The majority of the avifauna diversifies at a slow rate, without detectable ecological limits. However, Darwin's finches form an exception: they rapidly reach a carrying capacity and subsequently follow a coalescent-like diversification process. Together, these results suggest that avian diversity of remote islands is rising, and challenge the mutual exclusivity of the non-equilibrium and equilibrium ecological paradigms.},

	abstract = {The diversity and composition of biological communities might often depend on colonization history because early colonists can exclude future colonists through a priority effect. These priority effects, which have been observed across a wide variety of ecosystems, often arise because early colonists have sufficient time to use available resources efficiently and subsequently withhold them from invaders. Here, we explore the extent to which rapid local adaptive evolution contributes to the pervasiveness of these priority effects. Using an individual-based simulation, we show that early colonization allows the descendants of colonists to adapt to novel conditions and reduce the establishment success of an initially ecologically equivalent competing species. Our model predicts that slight differences in colonization timing and adaptive capacity between species can substantially alter the dynamics and diversity of communities. We also show that priority effects and gene flow can generate a novel mechanism for the expansion and retraction of species distributions in a metacommunity. Our results suggest that local adaptation combined with stochastic colonization events can obscure direct relationships between species distributions and environmental gradients. Given the increasing recognition of rapid, microgeographic evolution in natural populations, we expect that evolutionary priority effects could affect the structure and dynamics of many natural metacommunities.},

Here we test alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points). The data are body-size measurements taken from historical studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid, short-term evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1 Myr, the changes are constrained and do not accumulate over time. Over longer intervals (1–360 Myr), this pattern of bounded evolution yields to a pattern of increasing divergence with time. The best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a model that combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic change with bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We suggest that these rare bursts reflect permanent changes in adaptive zones, whereas the short-term fluctuations represent local variations in niche optima due to restricted environmental variation within a stable adaptive zone.},

	abstract = {Various hypotheses have been proposed for why the traits distinguishing humans from other primates originally evolved, and any given trait may have been explained both as an adaptation to different environments and as a result of demands from social organization or sexual selection. To find out how popular the different explanations are among scientists, we carried out an online survey among authors of recent scientific papers in journals covering relevant fields of science (paleoanthropology, paleontology, ecology, evolution, human biology). Some of the hypotheses were clearly more popular among the 1,266 respondents than others, but none was universally accepted or rejected. Even the most popular of the hypotheses were assessed “very likely” by {\textless}50\% of the respondents, but many traits had 1–3 hypotheses that were found at least moderately likely by {\textgreater}70\% of the respondents. An ordination of the hypotheses identified two strong gradients. Along one gradient, the hypotheses were sorted by their popularity, measured by the average credibility score given by the respondents. The second gradient separated all hypotheses postulating adaptation to swimming or diving into their own group. The average credibility scores given for different subgroups of the hypotheses were not related to respondent's age or number of publications authored. However, (paleo)anthropologists were more critical of all hypotheses, and much more critical of the water-related ones, than were respondents representing other fields of expertise. Although most respondents did not find the water-related hypotheses likely, only a small minority found them unscientific. The most popular hypotheses were based on inherent drivers; that is, they assumed the evolution of a trait to have been triggered by the prior emergence of another human-specific behavioral or morphological trait, but opinions differed as to which of the traits came first.},

Human activities are causing extinctions across a wide array of taxa. Yet there has been no evidence of humans directly causing extinction among our relatives, the apes. Turvey et al. describe a species of gibbon found in a 2200- to 2300-year-old tomb ascribed to a Chinese noblewoman. This previously unknown species was likely widespread, may have persisted until the 18th century, and may be the first ape species to have perished as a direct result of human activities. This discovery may also indicate the existence of unrecognized primate diversity across Asia.
Science, this issue p. 1346
Although all extant apes are threatened with extinction, there is no evidence for human-caused extinctions of apes or other primates in postglacial continental ecosystems, despite intensive anthropogenic pressures associated with biodiversity loss for millennia in many regions. Here, we report a new, globally extinct genus and species of gibbon, Junzi imperialis, described from a partial cranium and mandible from a {\textasciitilde}2200- to 2300-year-old tomb from Shaanxi, China. Junzi can be differentiated from extant hylobatid genera and the extinct Quaternary gibbon Bunopithecus by using univariate and multivariate analyses of craniodental morphometric data. Primates are poorly represented in the Chinese Quaternary fossil record, but historical accounts suggest that China may have contained an endemic ape radiation that has only recently disappeared.
A previously unknown gibbon species found in a Chinese tomb suggests that past Asian ape diversity has been lost.

The results were strikingly different between the two algorithms – Maxent models reconstructed the overall distributions of the species at low thresholds, but higher predictive levels of Maxent predictions reflected overfitting to the input data; GARP models, on the other hand, succeeded in anticipating most of the species’ distributional potential, at the cost of increased (apparent, at least) commission error. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) tests were weak in discerning models able to predict into broad unsampled areas from those that were not. Such transferability is clearly a novel challenge for modeling algorithms, and requires different qualities than does predicting within densely sampled landscapes – in this case, Maxent was transferable only at very low thresholds, and biases and gaps in input data may frequently affect results based on higher Maxent thresholds, requiring careful interpretation of model results.},

Dispute exists however, as to whether this distribution is a mathematical artifact of large numbers or whether it has a biological meaning. In analysing general lognormal curves we argue that the characteristics discovered by Preston relating to the canonical lognormal are in fact merely mathematical properties of the whole family of lognormal curves. We develop a model that assumes that a community is composed of groups of species each differently adapted to a habitat. By integrating the distributions of these groups a lognormal distribution results if the community is in equilibrium. If the community is disturbed however, many species change their abundance and then species abundance curves show multiple maxima and no longer conform to a single lognormal curve. /// Логонормальное распределение особей отдельных видов хорошо соответствует результатам разных серий экологических наблюдений. Однако, остается дискуссионным, является ли такое распределение математическим артефактом большого числа повторностей, либо оно имеет биологический смысл. При анализе общих логнормальных кривых мы полагаем, что характеристики, данные Престоном, близкие к каноническим логнормальным, имеют лишь математические особенности, присущие всей группе логнормальных кривых. Мы разработали модель, в которой сообщество состоит из групп видов, каждый из которых по-разному адаптирован к местообитанию. При интеграции распределения этих групп получается логнормальное распределение при условии, если сообщество уравновешено. Если сообщество нарущено, у многих видов меняется обилие и, таким образом, кривые видового обилия имеют многочисленные максимумы и больше не сводятся к единственной логнормальной кривой.},

	abstract = {Many studies have attempted to disentangle the effects of neutral and niche-mediated processes on community composition using partial Mantel tests and variance partitioning on dissimilarity matrices. Recently, doubts about the reliability of these methods have emerged. Here we explore how the results are affected by three confounding factors that may affect ecological data to different degrees: spatial autocorrelation of the environmental variables, length of the compositional gradient, and sampling noise. We document that the statistical hypotheses tested in these methods may or may not correspond to the ecological hypotheses of interest. A major discrepancy emerges if a large proportion of sampling units in the analysed dataset share no species, in which case compositional dissimilarities saturate to a fixed maximum value although explanatory dissimilarities do not. With increasing dissimilarity saturation, the explanatory power of regression models decrease, which may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the ecological processes represented by the explanatory variables are not operating. A survey of recent literature suggests that there is a general lack of awareness of this problem, although it appears to affect {\textgreater} 10\% of relevant studies. Our simulations show that if dissimilarity saturation is due to a long ecological gradient, extended dissimilarities essentially solve the problem for any degree of saturation. Using distances from a hybrid multidimensional scaling alleviates the saturation problem when the degree of saturation is {\textless} 60\%. However, neither correction method can provide a solution to problems caused by insufficient sampling. How the presence of multiple explanatory gradients in combination with sampling noise affects overall analysis performance remains to be clarified.},

With a very high proportion of endemic species and/or subspecies, the province of Almeria in Andalusia (SE Spain) represents a prominent hotspot of plant diversity in the Mediterranean Basin. In this paper, we use phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine whether narrow endemics (i.e. species mostly restricted to the Almeria Province, hereafter NE) have evolved a ‘syndrome of endemism’. Based on published trait values, we tested whether (i) NE occupy a particular altitudinal range, possess a smaller niche breadth and occur within particular plant associations, and whether (ii) NE have distinct vegetative and reproductive traits. We found that, compared to their more widespread congeners, NE (i) occupy a narrower altitudinal range at the upper or lower limits of their congeners’ ranges; (ii) occur in a smaller number of plant communities that are distinct from the communities of widespread species; and (iii) have an 11 \% shorter flowering duration, 28 \% fewer flowers per inflorescence, 30 \% reduced floral display, and 23 \% lower floral attractiveness. These differences are not explained by a smaller size overall or a different ploidy level. NE have apparently evolved traits that promote selfing. The shift towards higher selfing rates is interpreted as a mechanism to promote reproductive assurance and to decrease gene flow from the more widespread congeners.},

Three examples of a change from stable to unstable environmental conditions are presented on three different time scales: (1) the Mid Holocene (MH) wet–dry transition in the Chew Bahir basin (Southern Ethiopian Rift; between 11 ka and 4 ka), (2) the MIS 5–4 transition in the Naivasha basin (Central Kenya Rift; between 160 ka and 50 ka), and (3) the Early Mid Pleistocene Transition (EMPT) in the Olorgesailie basin (Southern Kenya Rift; between 1.25 Ma and 0.4 Ma). A probabilistic age modeling technique is used to determine the timing of these transitions, taking into account possible abrupt changes in the sedimentation rate including episodes of no deposition (hiatuses). Interestingly, the stable-unstable conditions identified in the three records are always associated with an orbitally-induced decrease of insolation: the descending portion of the 800 kyr cycle during the EMPT, declining eccentricity after the 115 ka maximum at the MIS 5–4 transition, and after ∼10 ka. This observation contributes to an evidence-based discussion of the possible mechanisms causing the switching between environmental stability and instability in Eastern Africa at three different orbital time scales (10,000 to 1,000,000 years) during the Cenozoic. This in turn may lead to great insights into the environmental changes occurring at the same time as hominin speciation, brain expansion, dispersal out of Africa, and cultural innovations and may provide key evidence to build new hypotheses regarding the causes of early human evolution.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the Order Proboscidea has been proposed as a series of adaptive shifts in response to changing environments and evolutionary trends in skull and dentition that were linked to increasing dietary specialization. The assumption that climate and environmental change are the driving forces behind evolution is prevalent in studies of adaptation and diversification. However, there are other forces at work that may be equally responsible for evolutionary change, those involving biotic interaction and competition. In this paper, a summary of the African proboscidean record is presented as a means to examine overall trends in diversity and adaptation. Specimens from 175 localities in East, Central, and Southern Africa were entered into a locality database. Proboscideans from these localities comprise 11 families, 27 genera, and 53 species. First Appearance Datum (FAD) and Last Appearance Datum (LAD) for each species were plotted in 1-million-year intervals. Three periods of diversification were noted, the first in the Oligocene, the second in the early-middle Miocene, and the last in the Pliocene. Three ecomorphological categories based on dental functional morphology were identified in each of the three periods, suggesting that these are stable categories through time. As a result, it is proposed that biotic competition (resulting in resource partitioning) played a more prominent role in proboscidean evolutionary change and diversity than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive paleoecological analyses of spatial and temporal turnover in species composition, the fidelity with which time-averaged death assemblages capture variation in species composition and diversity partitioning of living communities remains unexplored. Do death assemblages vary in composition between sites to a lesser degree than do living assemblages, as would be predicted from time-averaging? And is the higher number of species observed in death relative to living assemblages reduced with increasing spatial scale? We quantify the preservation of spatial and temporal variation in species composition using 11 regional data sets based on samples of living molluscan communities and their co-occurring time-averaged death assemblages. (1) Compositional dissimilarities among living assemblages (LA) within data sets are significantly positively rank-correlated to dissimilarities among counterpart pairs of death assemblages (DA), demonstrating that pairwise dissimilarity within a study area has a good preservation potential in the fossil record. Dissimilarity indices that downplay the abundance of dominant species return the highest live-dead agreement of variation in species composition. (2) The average variation in species composition (average dissimilarity) is consistently smaller in DAs than in LAs (9 of 11 data sets). This damping of variation might arise from DAs generally having a larger sample size, but the reduction by ∼10–20\% mostly persists even in size-standardized analyses (4 to 7 of 11 data sets, depending on metric). Beta diversity expressed by the number of compositionally distinct communities is also significantly reduced in death assemblages in size-standardized analyses (by ∼25\%). This damping of variation and reduction in beta diversity is in accord with the loss of temporal resolution expected from time-averaging, without invoking taphonomic bias (from differential preservation or postmortem transportation) or sample-size effects. The loss of temporal resolution should directly reduce temporal variation, and assuming time-for-space substitution owing to random walk within one habitat and/or temporal habitat shifting, it also decreases spatial variation in species composition. (3) DAs are more diverse than LAs at the alpha scale, but the difference is reduced at gamma scales because partitioning of alpha and beta components differs significantly between LAs and DAs. This indicates that the effects of time-averaging are reduced with increasing spatial scale. Thus, overall, time-averaged molluscan DAs do capture variation among samples of the living assemblage, but they tend to damp the magnitude of variation, making them a conservative means of inferring change over time or variation among regions in species composition and diversity. Rates of temporal and spatial species turnover documented in the fossil record are thus expected to be depressed relative to the turnover rates that are predicted by models of community dynamics, which assume higher temporal resolution. Finally, the capture by DAs of underlying variation in the LA implies little variation in the net preservation potential of death assemblages across environments, despite the different taphonomic pathways suggested by taphofacies studies.},

	abstract = {Many marine and terrestrial clades show similar latitudinal gradients in species richness, but opposite gradients in range size—on land, ranges are the smallest in the tropics, whereas in the sea, ranges are the largest in the tropics. Therefore, richness gradients in marine and terrestrial systems do not arise from a shared latitudinal arrangement of species range sizes. Comparing terrestrial birds and marine bivalves, we find that gradients in range size are concordant at the level of genera. Here, both groups show a nested pattern in which narrow-ranging genera are confined to the tropics and broad-ranging genera extend across much of the gradient. We find that (i) genus range size and its variation with latitude is closely associated with per-genus species richness and (ii) broad-ranging genera contain more species both within and outside of the tropics when compared with tropical- or temperate-only genera. Within-genus species diversification thus promotes genus expansion to novel latitudes. Despite underlying differences in the species range-size gradients, species-rich genera are more likely to produce a descendant that extends its range relative to the ancestor's range. These results unify species richness gradients with those of genera, implying that birds and bivalves share similar latitudinal dynamics in net species diversification.},

	abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two—way or three—way interspecific trade—offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade—offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

Here we report that two butterfly species have increased the variety of habitat types that they can colonize, and that two bush cricket species show increased fractions of longer-winged (dispersive) individuals in recently founded populations. Both ecological and evolutionary processes are probably responsible for these changes. Increased habitat breadth and dispersal tendencies have resulted in about 3- to 15-fold increases in expansion rates, allowing these insects to cross habitat disjunctions that would have represented major or complete barriers to dispersal before the expansions started. The emergence of dispersive phenotypes will increase the speed at which species invade new environments, and probably underlies the responses of many species to both past and future climate change.},

	abstract = {* 1The species–area relationship (SAR) has long been used to describe biological diversity across spatial scales. Theoretically, we can describe SARs exhaustively from patterns of species abundance and spatial distribution; where all species are equally common and randomly dispersed, SARs typically rise steeply and then decelerate when plotted on logarithmic axes, but uneven abundances and spatial aggregation lower the SAR curve.
* 2In this article, we have developed a generalized model of random placement without replacement for species-occupancy data sets to separate the effects of species abundance and spatial distribution. Observed departures from the model are used to assess the relative contributions of aggregation and unequal occupancy to curve shape. We have applied it both to modelled one- and two-species cases and to plant survey data at both small (1 × 1 m) and large (10 × 10 km) spatial resolutions.
* 3In modelled distributions, common species raise the SAR most strongly at fine scales, whereas increasingly rare species add to the curve at progressively coarser scales. The effect of aggregation on SAR curvature is greatest with rare species, which lower the curve at most scales, whereas commoner species do so only at fine scales. Uneven occupancies and aggregation may result in convex, concave, S-shaped or inverted S-shaped curves in log–log space.
* 4In analyses of field survey data, aggregation contributed less to lowering SAR curvature than did uneven occupancies, both in small and large scale data sets.

We have thus demonstrated that SAR shape reflects the distribution of species-occupancy and spatial patterning and provide practical methods for parsing the contributions of each to biodiversity across spatial scales. Given the prevalence of gridded occupancy biodiversity data, these methods should have broad application.},

	abstract = {Despite long-standing interest in elevational-diversity gradients, little is known about the processes that cause changes in the compositional variation of communities (β-diversity) across elevations. Recent studies have suggested that β-diversity gradients are driven by variation in species pools, rather than by variation in the strength of local community assembly mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, or local biotic interactions. However, tests of this hypothesis have been limited to very small spatial scales that limit inferences about how the relative importance of assembly mechanisms may change across spatial scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that scale-dependent community assembly mechanisms shape biogeographic β-diversity gradients using one of the most well-characterized elevational gradients of tropical plant diversity. Using an extensive dataset on woody plant distributions along a 4,000-m elevational gradient in the Bolivian Andes, we compared observed patterns of β-diversity to null-model expectations. β-deviations (standardized differences from null values) were used to measure the relative effects of local community assembly mechanisms after removing sampling effects caused by variation in species pools. To test for scale-dependency, we compared elevational gradients at two contrasting spatial scales that differed in the size of local assemblages and regions by at least an order of magnitude. Elevational gradients in β-diversity persisted after accounting for regional variation in species pools. Moreover, the elevational gradient in β-deviations changed with spatial scale. At small scales, local assembly mechanisms were detectable, but variation in species pools accounted for most of the elevational gradient in β-diversity. At large spatial scales, in contrast, local assembly mechanisms were a dominant force driving changes in β-diversity. In contrast to the hypothesis that variation in species pools alone drives β-diversity gradients, we show that local community assembly mechanisms contribute strongly to systematic changes in β-diversity across elevations. We conclude that scale-dependent variation in community assembly mechanisms underlies these iconic gradients in global biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package (i) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; (ii) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; (iii) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.

	abstract = {Research on the ecological impacts of environmental change has primarily focused at the species level, leaving the responses of ecosystem-level properties like energy flow poorly understood. This is especially so over millennial timescales inaccessible to direct observation. Here we examine how energy flow within a Great Basin small mammal community responded to climate-driven environmental change during the past 12,800 y, and use this baseline to evaluate responses observed during the past century. Our analyses reveal marked stability in energy flow during rapid climatic warming at the terminal Pleistocene despite dramatic turnover in the distribution of mammalian body sizes and habitat-associated functional groups. Functional group turnover was strongly correlated with climate-driven changes in regional vegetation, with climate and vegetation change preceding energetic shifts in the small mammal community. In contrast, the past century has witnessed a substantial reduction in energy flow caused by an increase in energetic dominance of small-bodied species with an affinity for closed grass habitats. This suggests that modern changes in land cover caused by anthropogenic activities—particularly the spread of nonnative annual grasslands—has led to a breakdown in the compensatory dynamics of energy flow. Human activities are thus modifying the small mammal community in ways that differ from climate-driven expectations, resulting in an energetically novel ecosystem. Our study illustrates the need to integrate across ecological and temporal scales to provide robust insights for long-term conservation and management.},

Sixty one sites were sampled along 90 metres of stratigraphic section extending from the base of Bed I into the Masek Beds. Palaeo- and rock-magnetic analyses reveal that magnetizations are stable, carried by low coercivity magnetic minerals (titano-magnetites) and are likely to be of depositional origin. A revised magnetostratigraphic scale is proposed. The base of the major normal magnetozone, N1, interpreted as the Olduvai sub-chron, lies ca 6 m below Tuff IA, i.e. significantly below the previously defined position. This revision, associated to 40Ar/39Ar ages recently determined on the Tuffs of Bed I, supports the validity of the astronomical calibration of the geomagnetic polarity time scale for the Olduvai sub-chron. The correlation of the normal magnetozone N2 with Jaramillo (or Jaramillo + Cobb Mountain), is suggested by the discovery of a reverse magnetozone (R3) in the uppermost part of the Pleistocene sequence (Masek Beds), and implies that the fossiliferous sequence of the Olduvai Formation was entirely deposited before the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary.},

However, the bias induced on the regression by the arbitrary choice of local and regional area has threatened to undermine this consensus and has even led to the proposal to abandon the regression method entirely. Nonetheless, the use of regression analysis to determine local–regional richness relationships continues. We performed a meta-analysis of almost 100 data sets using a log-ratio-based regression model that is free of the scale-induced bias inherent in more commonly used models. This reanalysis contradicts the general consensus: saturated relationships are at least as common as unsaturated patterns. However, a discouragingly large proportion of studies produce no discernable patterns at all.

	abstract = {Over 200 hominid specimens were recovered by the International Omo Expedition of 1967–1976. Despite the fragmentary nature of this primarily dental collection, these hominid remains represent a major body of evidence about hominid evolution in eastern Africa during the 2–3 myr time period. Our analysis of the Omo dental collection is based on a large comparative sample of 375 quantifiable mandibular postcanine teeth of A. afarensis, A. africanus, A. aethiopicus, A. boisei, A. robustus, and early Homo. A total of 48 isolated mandibular premolars and molars of the Omo collection spanning the 2–3 myr time period is sufficiently preserved to allow reliable serial allocations and intertaxon comparisons and is the object of study in this paper. We present taxonomic identifications of these teeth and seven other mandibular specimens preserving tooth crowns. Metric analyses of this study include cusp area and crown shape variables taken on occlusal view diagrams. Nonmetric analyses were based on simultaneous observations of all relevant material to ensure accuracy of categorical evaluations. First, a combined metric and morphological evaluation was conducted to allocate each Omo tooth to either robust or nonrobust categories. Further taxonomic affinities were then examined. Our results indicate that nonrobust and robust lineages cooccur by circa 2.7 myr. We consider the Shungura robust specimens from Members C through F to represent A. aethiopicus. A significant phenetic transformation occurs at circa 2.3 myr, with the mosaic emergence of the derived A. boisei morphology across Member G times. Characterization of the East African nonrobust lineage is more difficult because of the comparatively subtle morphological differences seen among the dentitions of A. afarensis, A. africanus, and early Homo. The earlier Members B and C nonrobust specimens are difficult to evaluate and are considered indeterminate to genus or species. Both molars and premolars from Members E through G exhibit phenetic similarities to the early Homo condition and are considered as aff. Homo sp. indet. At present, there is no indication of multiple species in the Omo nonrobust sample at any time horizon. The 2–2.4 myr Omo nonrobust specimens exhibit some similarities to the stated Homo “rudolfensis” condition in size and morphology and are likely to represent the ancestral condition of the genus Homo. The bearing of these results on interpretations of early hominid evolution and diversification is considered. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {We examine a hypothesized relationship between two descriptions of community structure: the niche-overlap dendrogram that describes the ecological similarities of species and the pattern of relative abundances. Specifically, we examine the way in which this relationship follows from the niche hierarchy model, whose fundamental assumption is a direct connection between abundances and underlying hierarchical community organization. We test three important, although correlated, predictions of the niche hierarchy model and show that they are upheld in a set of 11 communities (encompassing fishes, amphibians, lizards, and birds) where both abundances and dendrograms were reported. First, species that are highly nested in the dendrogram are on average less abundant than species from branches less subdivided. Second, and more significantly, more equitable community abundances are associated with more evenly branched dendrogram structures, whereas less equitable abundances are associated with less even dendrograms. This relationship shows that abundance patterns can give insight into less visible aspects of community organization. Third, one can recover the distribution of proportional abundances seen in assemblages containing two species by treating each branch point in the dendrogram as a two-species case. This reconstruction cannot be achieved if abundances and the dendrogram are unrelated and suggests a method for hierarchically decomposing systems. To our knowledge, this is the first test of a species abundance model based on nontrivial predictions as to the origins and causes of abundance patterns, and not simply on the goodness-of-fit of distributions.},

	abstract = {1. Environmental sorting, historical factors and neutral dynamics may all drive beta diversity (change in species composition across space), but their relative importance remains unresolved. In the case of European mammals, key potential drivers of large-scale beta diversity include current climate, neutral dynamics and two historical factors: Pleistocene glaciations and peninsular dynamics (immigration from extra-regional eastern faunal source areas and inter-linked relictual survival and evolutionary differentiation in isolated areas). 2. We assessed the relative importance of these drivers using a novel analytical framework to deconstruct beta diversity of non-volant mammals in Europe (138 species) into its turnover (change in species composition because of species replacements) and nestedness components (change in species composition because of species richness differences) at continental and regional (250 000 km2) scales. 3. We found continental-scale mammal beta diversity to be mainly caused by spatial turnover (99·9\%), with only a small contribution (0·1\%) from nestedness. 4. Current climate emerged as an important driver of beta diversity, given the strong continental-scale turnover, particularly in north–south direction, i.e., in line with the latitudinal climate gradient, and, more directly, the strong correlation of climate with spatial turnover at both continental and regional scales. 5. However, there was also evidence for the importance of non-climatic drivers. Notably, the compositional variation purely accounted for by space was greater than that purely accounted for by environment for both the turnover and the nestedness component of beta diversity. Furthermore, the strong longitudinal turnover within Southern Europe is in accordance with the region’s long-term climatic stability having allowed multiple refugia and local evolutionary diversification. As expected from peninsular dynamics, there was increasing dissimilarity with geographic distance in an east–west direction because of nestedness, but only in Central and Northern Europe. 6. In conclusion, European mammal beta diversity mainly reflects spatial turnover and only to a limited extent nestedness and is driven by current climate in combination with historical – and perhaps, neutral – dynamics. These findings suggest that a key challenge for climate-change predictive studies will be taking the influence of non-climatic factors into account.},

This and subsequent finds, mostly from Kenya's Turkana basin, resulted in its characterization as a specialized Australopithecus species with a hyper-robust masticatory apparatus,,. A distinct A. boisei facial morphology has been emphasized to differentiate robust Australopithecus lineages from East and South Africa. A preference for closed and/or wet habitats has been hypothesized. Here we report some new A. boisei specimens, including the taxon's first cranium and associated mandible, from Konso, Ethiopia. These fossils extend the known geographical range of A. boisei. They provide clear evidence for the coexistence of A. boisei and Homo erectus within a predominantly dry grassland environment. The A. boisei specimens from Konso demonstrate considerable morphological variation within the species. The unexpected combination of cranial and facial features of this skull cautions against the excessive taxonomic splitting of early hominids based on morphological detail documented in small and/or geographically restricted samples.},

	doi = {10.1537/ase.061203},
	abstract = {Homo erectus has been broadly defined to include fossils from Africa, Asia, and possibly Europe, or restricted to a supposedly confined Asian clade. Recently discovered fossils of H. erectus are allowing new insights into aspects of its evolution, such as the timing and mode of the species’ emergence in Africa and its relationship to Asian populations. However, the currently available African record predating 1.0 Ma is poor, consisting of the Turkana basin, Olduvai and the more limited South African materials. Here, we describe and compare eight craniodental fossils of {\textasciitilde}1.4 Ma recovered from Konso, Ethiopia, that we attribute to H. erectus. These include KGA10-1, one of the better-preserved H. erectus mandibular specimens known from eastern Africa, and other fragmentary dental and cranial remains. The Konso H. erectus fossils show a mosaic of primitive and derived features. These include a large and thick mandibular corpus, a moderately developed lateral prominence, a reduced premolar morphology, and a tendency for smaller relative sizes of the posterior molars compared with earlier Homo. In some dentognathic details, such as the lack of a buccolingually narrow M1 and the presence of double mental foramina, the Konso fossils differ from eastern African H. erectus of ≥1.5 Ma. The fragmentary cranial remains exhibit weak angular and occipital tori, and an apparently weak occipital flexion, as with the eastern African H. erectus examples known from {\textasciitilde}1.65 to 1.2 Ma. The available evidence is consistent with the interpretation that African early H. erectus shows morphological continuity within the {\textasciitilde}1.65 to 1.0 Ma time period, with relatively little morphological evolution prior to 1.4 Ma and advanced dentognathic gracility occurring sometime thereafter. The Konso evidence corroborates the hypothesis that the African H. erectus populations represent a variable but continuous evolutionary succession that was a likely source of multiple events of gene flow to the Eurasian continent.},

	abstract = {Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is posited to be a fundamental control on the structure and dynamics of ecological networks, influencing organism resource use and rates of senescence. Differences in the maintenance energy requirements of individual species therefore potentially predict extinction likelihood. If validated, this would comprise an important link between organismic ecology and macroevolutionary dynamics. To test this hypothesis, the BMRs of organisms within fossil species were determined using body size and temperature data, and considered in the light of species' survival and extinction through time. Our analysis focused on the high-resolution record of Pliocene to recent molluscs (bivalves and gastropods) from the Western Atlantic. Species-specific BMRs were calculated by measuring the size range of specimens from museum collections, determining ocean temperature using the HadCM3 global climate model, and deriving values based on relevant equations. Intriguingly, a statistically significant difference in metabolic rate exists between those bivalve and gastropod taxa that went extinct and those that survived throughout the course of the Neogene. This indicates that there is a scaling up from organismic properties to species survival for these communities. Metabolic rate could therefore represent an important metric for predicting future extinction patterns, with changes in global climate potentially affecting the lifespan of individuals, ultimately leading to the extinction of the species they are contained within. We also find that, at the assemblage level, there are no significant differences in metabolic rates for different time intervals throughout the entire study period. This may suggest that Neogene mollusc communities have remained energetically stable, despite many extinctions.},

Kenya, East Africa, spanning the last ∼100,000 years, with multiproxy palaeoenvironmental data, in order to determine the mechanisms underlying Late Quaternary variations in carbon cycling at different altitudes. The amplitude of down-core variations in the δ13C values of total organic carbon varied from 4.8‰ to 17.4‰. The δ13C signals in compounds of terrestrial, aquatic-macrophyte and algal origin were tightly coupled, reflecting strong atmospheric control. During the early glacial and the last glacial maximum, the effects of sub-ambient CO2 and enhanced moisture stress reinforced each other, resulting in carbon starvation and very high δ13C values. In contrast, smaller, millennial-scale shifts in δ13C during the late-glacial and Holocene were driven primarily by fluctuations in monsoon precipitation. However, the impact of Late Quaternary atmospheric changes were complex, involving variations in biomass burning, vegetation cover, soil erosion, lake levels and water chemistry in addition to direct physiological responses by higher plants and algae.},

Differentiating cladogenesis from anagenesis, defined as evolution within a species, has generally been hampered by dating precision, insufficient fossil data, and difficulties in establishing a direct link between morphological changes detectable in the fossil record and biological species. Here we quantify the relative frequencies of cladogenesis and anagenesis for macroperforate planktic Foraminifera, which arguably have the most complete fossil record currently available, to address this question. Analyzing this record in light of molecular evidence, while taking into account the precision of fossil dating techniques, we estimate that the fraction of speciation events attributable to anagenesis is {\textless}19\% during the Cenozoic era (last 65 Myr) and {\textless}10\% during the Neogene period (last 23 Myr). Our central conclusion—that cladogenesis is the predominant mode by which new planktic Foraminifera taxa become established at macroevolutionary time scales—differs markedly from the conclusion reached in a recent study based solely on fossil data. These disparate findings demonstrate that interpretations of macroevolutionary dynamics in the fossil record can be fundamentally altered in light of genetic evidence.},

	abstract = {Effects of temperature changes on phytoplankton communities seem to be highly context-specific, but few studies have analyzed whether this context specificity depends on differences in the abiotic conditions or in species composition between studies. We present an experiment that allows disentangling the contribution of abiotic and biotic differences in shaping the response to two aspects of temperature change: permanent increase of mean temperature versus pulse disturbance in form of a heat wave. We used natural communities from six different sites of a floodplain system as well as artificially mixed communities from laboratory cultures and grew both, artificial and natural communities, in water from the six different floodplain lakes (sites). All 12 contexts (2 communities × 6 sites) were first exposed to three different temperature levels (12, 18, 24 °C, respectively) and afterward to temperature pulses (4 °C increase for 7 h day−1). Temperature-dependent changes in biomass and community composition depended on the initial composition of phytoplankton communities. Abiotic conditions had a major effect on biomass of phytoplankton communities exposed to different temperature conditions, however, the effect of biotic and abiotic conditions together was even more pronounced. Additionally, phytoplankton community responses to pulse temperature effects depended on the warming history. By disentangling abiotic and biotic effects, our study shows that temperature-dependent effects on phytoplankton communities depend on both, biotic and abiotic constraints.},

This book is a detailed examination of these principles, using data from a wide array of vertebrates but minimizing technical details and terminology. It is written for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and more senior scientists who already know something about “the brain,” but want a deeper understanding of how diverse brains evolved. The book\&apos;s central theme is that evolutionary changes in absolute brain size tend to correlate with many other aspects of brain structure and function, including the proportional size of individual brain regions, their complexity, and their neuronal connections. To explain these correlations, the book delves into rules of brain development and asks how changes in brain structure impact function and behavior. Two chapters focus specifically on how mammal brains diverged from other brains and how Homo sapiens evolved a very large and “special” brain.},

	abstract = {Properties of stratigraphic completeness are determined here from a Brownian motion model of sediment accumulation. This avoids flaws inherent in application of a discrete-time random walk to the time span, rather than thickness, of sediment layers. Both discrete and continuous models show that the concept of stratigraphic completeness is meaningful only when the time scale is specified. From the discrete model, not surprisingly, completeness improves with increasing relative frequency and average thickness of depositional increments and the error of completeness estimation should decrease for longer sections. The continuous model shows that two dimensionless products determine the probability that a given time interval will be recorded by some preserved sediment. The first is the ratio of the age of the interval to its time span; the second is the product of the square root of the time span and ratio of the mean to the standard deviation of accumulation rate. Expected completeness is the average of these probabilities for all successive intervals of the given time span. For long sections, completeness may be estimated from the second dimensionless product alone. The two dimensionless products are sufficient to predict the relationship of accumulation rate to time span, the distribution of bed thickness, and the weak association of completeness and section thickness.},

We investigated the neurophysiological demands of stone toolmaking by training modern subjects in known Paleolithic methods (“Oldowan”, “Acheulean”) and collecting structural and functional brain imaging data as they made technical judgments (outcome prediction, strategic appropriateness) about planned actions on partially completed tools. Results show that this task affected neural activity and functional connectivity in dorsal prefrontal cortex, that effect magnitude correlated with the frequency of correct strategic judgments, and that the frequency of correct strategic judgments was predictive of success in Acheulean, but not Oldowan, toolmaking. This corroborates hypothesized cognitive control demands of Acheulean toolmaking, specifically including information monitoring and manipulation functions attributed to the "central executive" of working memory. More broadly, it develops empirical methods for assessing the differential cognitive demands of Paleolithic technologies, and expands the scope of evolutionary hypotheses that can be tested using the available archaeological record.},

Unfortunately, testing of this idea has been hampered by a lack of objective, generalizable methods for measuring the structural complexity of real-world behaviors. Here we present a data-driven approach for quantifying hierarchical structure by extracting action grammars from basic ethograms. We apply this method to the evolutionarily-relevant behavior of stone tool-making by comparing sequences from the experimental replication of {\textasciitilde}2.5 Mya Oldowan vs. more recent {\textasciitilde}0.5 Mya Achuelean tools. Results show that, while using the same 'alphabet' of elementary actions, Acheulean sequences are structurally more complex. Beyond its specific evolutionary implications, this finding illustrates the broader applicability of our method to investigate the structure of naturalistic human behaviors and cognition. We demonstrate one application by using our complexity measures to re-analyze data from an fMRI study of tool-making action observation.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries of new fossil hominid species have been accompanied by several phylogenetic hypotheses. All of these hypotheses are based on a consideration of hominid craniodental morphology. However, Collard and Wood (2000) suggested that cladograms derived from craniodental data are inconsistent with the prevailing hypothesis of ape phylogeny based on molecular data. The implication of their study is that craniodental characters are unreliable indicators of phylogeny in hominoids and fossil hominids but, notably, their analysis did not include extinct species. We report here on a cladistic analysis designed to test whether the inclusion of fossil taxa affects the ability of morphological characters to recover the molecular ape phylogeny. In the process of doing so, the study tests both Collard and Wood's (2000) hypothesis of character reliability, and the several recently proposed hypotheses of early hominid phylogeny. One hundred and ninety-eight craniodental characters were examined, including 109 traits that traditionally have been of interest in prior studies of hominoid and early hominid phylogeny, and 89 craniometric traits that represent size-corrected linear dimensions measured between standard cranial landmarks. The characters were partitioned into two data sets. One set contained all of the characters, and the other omitted the craniometric characters. Six parsimony analyses were performed; each data set was analyzed three times, once using an ingroup that consisted only of extant hominoids, a second time using an ingroup of extant hominoids and extinct early hominids, and a third time excluding Kenyanthropus platyops. Results suggest that the inclusion of fossil taxa can play a significant role in phylogenetic analysis. Analyses that examined only extant taxa produced most parsimonious cladograms that were inconsistent with the ape molecular tree. In contrast, analyses that included fossil hominids were consistent with that tree. This consistency refutes the basis for the hypothesis that craniodental characters are unreliable for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships. Regarding early hominids, the relationships of Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Ardipithecus ramidus were relatively unstable. However, there is tentative support for the hypotheses that S. tchadensis is the sister taxon of all other hominids. There is support for the hypothesis that A. anamensis is the sister taxon of all hominids except S. tchadensis and Ar. ramidus. There is no compelling support for the hypothesis that Kenyanthropus platyops shares especially close affinities with Homo rudolfensis. Rather, K. platyops is nested within the Homo+Paranthropus+Australopithecus africanus clade. If K. platyops is a valid species, these relationships suggest that Homo and Paranthropus are likely to have diverged from other hominids much earlier than previously supposed. There is no support for the hypothesis that A. garhi is either the sister taxon or direct ancestor of the genus Homo. Phylogenetic relationships indicate that Australopithecus is paraphyletic. Thus, A. anamensis and A. garhi should be allocated to new genera.},

	abstract = {Basicranial features were examined in catarrhine primates and early hominids in order to demonstrate how information about morphological integration can be incorporated into phylogenetic analysis. Hypotheses purporting to explain the functional and structural relationships of basicranial characters were tested using factor analysis. Characters found to be functionally or structurally related to each other were then further examined in order to determine whether there was evidence that they were phylogenetically independent. If phylogenetic independence could not be demonstrated, then the characters were presumed to be integrated and were grouped into a complex. That complex was then treated as if it were a single character for the purposes of cladistic analysis. Factor analysis revealed that five basicranial features may be structurally related to relative brain size in hominoids. Depending on how one defines phylogenetic independence, as few as two, or as many as all of those characters might be morphologically integrated. A cladistic analysis of early hominids based on basicranial features revealed that the use of integrated complexes had a substantial effect on the phylogenetic position of Australopithecus africanus, a species whose relationships are poorly resolved. Moreover, the use of complexes also had an effect on reanalyses of certain published cladistic data sets, implying that those studies might have been biased by patterns of basicranial integration. These results demonstrate that patterns of morphological integration need to be considered carefully in all morphology-based cladistic analyses, regardless of taxon or anatomical focus. However, an important caveat is that the functional and structural hypotheses tested here predicted much higher degrees of integration than were observed. This result warns strongly that hypotheses of integration must be tested before they can be adequately employed in phylogenetic analysis. The uncritical acceptance of an untested hypothesis of integration is likely to be as disruptive to a cladistic analysis as when integration is ignored.

True endpoints are parameters that may be estimated using only the assumption that fossil finds are distributed randomly between them. If thickness is rescaled so that true endpoints lie at 0 and 1, the joint distribution of gap lengths between fossil finds is given by the Dirichlet distribution. Observed ends of the range are maximum likelihood estimators of true endpoints, but they are biased seriously. Extension of the observed range at each end by a distance equal to the average gap length yields unbiased point estimators. Classical statistics can generate confidence intervals for ends of the taxon range; but with Bayesian inference, the probability that true endpoints lie in a certain region can be stated. For a 95\% confidence level (classical) or a 95\% probability (Bayesian), the range extensions exceed the observed range if the range is established on less than six finds; if only two finds are used, such range extensions are an order of magnitude longer than the observed range. Evidently the standard biostratigraphic practice that identifies zonal boundaries as horizons rather than confidence intervals may not be justified at the resolution of typical fossiliferous sections.},

The dilution effect seeks to explain this variation by linking multiple host species to disease transmission. It predicts that disease risk increases for a focal host when host species diversity declines. However, when an increase in species diversity does not reduce disease, we are often unable to diagnose why. Here, we increase mechanistic and predictive clarity of the dilution effect with a general trait-based model of disease transmission in multi-host communities. Then, we parameterise and empirically test our model with a multi-generational case study of planktonic disease. The model-experiment combination shows that hosts that vary in competitive ability (R*) and potential to spread disease (R0) can produce three qualitatively disparate outcomes of dilution on disease: the dilution effect can succeed, fail, or be ambiguous/irrelevant.},

	abstract = {Aim Understanding complex ecological phenomena, such as the determinants of species richness, is best achieved by investigating their properties at different spatial scales. Factors significantly affecting the number of species occurring at one scale may not impact on richness at other scales. While this scale dependence has become increasingly recognized, there still remains a need to elucidate exactly how richness is structured across scales, and which mechanisms are influential for determining this important community property. This study explores how woody plant species richness varies in a fragmented system at multiple scales, and which factors are primarily responsible for these patterns. Location The study area is located in the Sonoran Desert within the bounds of metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, which is the locus of the Central Arizona–Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP-LTER) site. Methods Estimates of local and fragment plant species richness were generated from field data collected from 22 sites. Independent variables describing fragment sites were also calculated, including area, habitat heterogeneity, density of individuals, mean elevation, and extent of isolation. Structural equation modelling, multiple regression, and analysis of covariance were used to assess the contribution of independent variables to richness at the fragment and local scales. Results Fragment species richness was significantly influenced by area, though not isolation, habitat heterogeneity, mean elevation, or density of individuals. Local richness was not significantly related to fragment area, but was positively related to fragment richness, plant density, and elevation. Main conclusions The fragment species–area effect resulted from larger remnants supporting higher numbers of individuals at comparable densities, increasing richness through either passive sampling of progressively less common species and/or lower extinction rates among larger populations. Without using multi-temporal data it is not possible to disentangle these mechanisms. We found that patterns evident at one scale are not necessarily apparent at other scales, as elevation and density of individuals significantly affected richness at the local scale but not at the fragment scale. These results lend support to the concept that mechanisms influencing the species richness of natural communities may be operable only within certain domains and that relevant scales should be specified.},

	abstract = {Eastern and southern Africa experienced ongoing climatic and tectonic instability in the Plio-Pleistocene, alongside declining forests and expanding grasslands. Most known hominin genera (Australopithecus spp., Kenyanthropus, Paranthropus spp., Homo spp.) appear roughly between 4.2 and 1.8 Ma (millions of years ago). Explanations for these speciation events have focused on adaptations to environmental change, particularly in terrestrial biomes. However, the links between environmental change and hominin adaptations have not always been clear. Often overlooked is that Plio-Pleistocene vegetation included not just terrestrial environments, but a large component of edaphic (wet) C4 grasses and sedges. In this paper it is suggested that in response to environmental fluctuations, hominins engaged in conservative long-term ecological and dietary patterns, based on predictable C4/C3 wetland and terrestrial resources. Data are presented from six hominin locales, which demonstrate reliance on plant-based resources (sedges, grasses, and other vegetation) in C4-inclusive wetland/savanna mosaics. After roughly 2.4 Ma, severe climate variability is associated with early Homo and perhaps Paranthropus boisei broadening their diet to familiar but less preferred foods: vertebrates and invertebrates. These foods consistently provided early Homo with essential nutrients, which reduced selection pressures and allowed for increases in brain size. After 1.65 Ma, a 20\% increase in the C4 dietary component of Homo occurs alongside increased relative brain size. P. boisei also increases its C4 dietary component by 15\% after 1.65 Ma. These increases imply that both taxa continued to broaden their diet within the C4-based wetlands/savanna biome, with Homo putting a greater emphasis on mammals.},

	abstract = {Species invasions are pervasive in Earth history, yet the ecological and evolutionary consequences vary greatly. Ancient invasion events can be organized in a hierarchy of increasing invasion intensity from ephemeral invasions to globally pervasive invasive regimes. Each level exhibits emergent properties exceeding the sum of interactions at lower levels. Hierarchy levels correspond to, but do not always exactly correlate with, geographic extent of invasion success. The ecological impacts of lower-level impacts can be negligible or result in temporary community accommodation. Invasion events at moderate to high levels of the hierarchy permanently alter ecological communities, regional faunas, and global ecosystems. The prevalence of invasive species results in evolutionary changes by fostering niche evolution, differential survival of ecologically generalized taxa, faunal homogenization, and suppressing speciation. These impacts can contribute to mass extinctions and biodiversity crises that alter the trajectory of ecological and evolutionary patterns of life. The fossil record provides a long-term record of how invasion impacts may scale up through time, which can augment ecological studies of modern species invasions.},

Geology had made remarkable progress toward an understanding of the phys ical history of the Caribbean Basin for the last 100 million years or so. On the biological side, many new discoveries had elucidated the distributional history of terrestrial orga nisms in and between the two Americas. Geological and biological data had been combined to yield the timing of important events with unprecedented resolution. Clearly, when each of two broad disciplines is making notable advances and when each provides new insights for the other, the rewards of cross-disciplinary contacts increase exponentially. The present volume represents an attempt to bring together a group of geologists, paleontologists and biologists capable of exploiting this opportunity through presentation of an interdisciplinary synthesis of evidence and hypothesis concerning interamerican connections during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. Advances in plate tectonics form the basis for a modern synthesis and, in the broadest terms, dictate the framework within which the past and present distributions of organisms must be interpreted. Any scientific dis cipline must seek tests of its conclusions from data outside of its own confines.},

The absence of crown catarrhine fossils older than ∼20 million years (Myr) has stood in stark contrast to molecular divergence estimates of ∼25–30 Myr for the split between Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and Hominoidea (apes), implying long ghost lineages for both clades2,3,4. Here we describe the oldest known fossil ‘ape’, represented by a partial mandible preserving dental features that place it with ‘nyanzapithecine’ stem hominoids. Additionally, we report the oldest stem member of the Old World monkey clade, represented by a lower third molar. Both specimens were recovered from a precisely dated 25.2-Myr-old stratum in the Rukwa Rift, a segment of the western branch of the East African Rift in Tanzania. These finds extend the fossil record of apes and Old World monkeys well into the Oligocene epoch of Africa, suggesting a possible link between diversification of crown catarrhines and changes in the African landscape brought about by previously unrecognized tectonic activity5 in the East African rift system.},

Our morphometric comparisons are based on 24 variables, for which we have made more than 43,000 individual measurements normalized for shell size. We initially assessed evolutionary changes in shape for 19 early Pliocene (4 ma old) species of bivalves by comparing these forms to their closest living relatives, which in 12 cases have traditonally been assigned to the same species. To make our study unbiased and comprehensive, we included all species that met certain predetermined guidelines and that offered suitable fossil material for measurement. We compared early Pliocene and Recent populations using (1) all 24 variables treated separately, (2) multivariate distance (Mahalanobis' D), based on the full set of variables, and (3) eigenshapes for shell outlines. For these comparisons, we used as a yardstick the same measures of morphologic distance applied to pairs of geographically separated Recent populations that belong to eight of the living species to which the fossil populations were compared. As it turns out, with minor exceptions, the distribution of morphologic distances between 4 ma old and Recent populations resembled the distribution of distances between conspecific Recent populations.We calculated net rates of evolution separating pairs of populations that belong to single lineages. For all intervals of time, the distribution of differences between population means for individual variables is remarkably similar to a comparable distribution representing the comparison of pairs of conspecific Recent populations from separate geographic regions. Because morphologic differences between populations do not vary greatly with evolutionary time, measured “rates” of evolution, on the average, decrease with interval of measurement. Because these differences resemble intraspecific variability, however, the rates do not represent significant evolution. Evolution has followed a weak zigzag course, yielding only trivial net trends.The weak and reversible “trends” that we measured yield net rates averaging less than 10 millidarwins, which is much lower than most rates previously reported for marine invertebrates (average {\textasciitilde}200 millidarwins for a 1 ma interval and {\textasciitilde}60 millidarwins for a 10 ma interval). We attribute this disparity (1) to the fact that most previously published rates have been calculated when a significant amount of evolution was recognized in advance (often for a poorly documented lineage) and (2) to the fact that most measured variables have represented nothing more than some measure of body size. We conclude that shape, as opposed to size, has been highly stable in bivalve evolution over millions of years and 106–107 generations. We conclude that to characterize rates or evolution for any group of organisms, one must employ a large, unbiased sample of measurements for numerous well-documented lineages, and one must segregate data depicting shape from data depicting size.},

	abstract = {Being of especially high quality, the Neogene fossil record of planktonic foraminifera offers special opportunities for assessing patterns of extinction and speciation. A variety of metrics indicates that within this group the mean duration of lineages has been much shorter (rate of extinction has been higher) for the globorotaliid clade than for the globigerinid clade. Furthermore, in the globorotaliid clade rates of extinction and speciation have not been closely linked to changes in diversity, but rather have been relatively high even at times when diversity has undergone little change. Thus, the globorotaliid clade has undergone more rapid evolutionary turnover than the globigerinid clade. Data for living species reveal that neither geographic range nor temperature tolerance is the primary factor controlling lineage duration. On the other hand, there is evidence that lineages marked by low abundance (small population size) are relatively short-lived. The reason that globorotaliid lineages have generally survived for shorter intervals, on the average, may be that their populations have been less abundant and less stable. Usually they live deeper in the water column, where food is often sparse, and many flourish only in areas of upwelling. Furthermore, the globorotaliids lack symbiotic algae for nutritional support. The same ecological factors may have accelerated speciation in the globorotaliid clade, by causing species to be patchily distributed. Thus, population size and structure have been more important than geographic range in determining rates of extinction and speciation. This parallels the situation for Neogene marine bivalves.For planktonic foraminifera, as for Western Atlantic Bivalvia, the normal pattern of extinction was reversed in late Pliocene time, apparently in response to climatic cooling. The globigerinids suffered a sudden pulse of extinction. The deeper dwelling globorotaliids fared better; probably many of their species benefited from elevation of the seasonal thermocline into the photic zone. At the same time, rate of speciation declined in the globorotaliid clade, which supports the idea, inferred from the evolutionary history of marine bivalves, that an increase in the size and stability of populations should depress both rate of extinction and rate of speciation.},

My goal here is to present a qualitative model to further our understanding about the driving forces of plant taxonomic richness across spatial scales.
* 2The model attempts to predict local plant species richness based on previous work regarding (i) correlations between temperature, precipitation and richness, (ii) correlations between soil nutrient availability and richness derived from both descriptions and experimental manipulations, and (iii) empirical demonstrations of the importance of the species pool in regulating local species richness.
* 3The model consists of a phenomenlogical submodel of the multiplicative effects of temperature, water and mineral nutrients on plant species richness, with a spatially implicit submodel of immigration and extinction of species in local communities.
* 4The model makes the following five testable predictions. (i) Local richness increases linearly with immigration rate of new species and curvilinearly with local extinction rate. (ii) The effects of altered local immigration and extinction rates will be most apparent in local communities embedded in species-rich metacommunities. (iii) Local communities are not saturated, but rather increase in richness directly with increasing metacommunity richness. (iv) Unimodal or hump-shaped productivity-richness relations arise when low water or temperature limit diversity at low productivity and mineral nutrients limit diversity at high productivity. (v) An apparent scale-dependence of the effect productivity on richness should arise when there exists a matching scale-dependence of the underlying environmental drivers. These predictions do not contrast sharply with available data, but remain largely untested.
* 5I suggest that continued attempts to synthesize the most predictive patterns emerging from the burgeoning global data bases of both taxonomic and genetic diversity will guide us toward mechanistic explanations of the determinants of species richness, suggest why special cases differ from general patterns, and provide additional novel predictions not currently apparent.},

We examined how attributes of New World bat diversity vary with each other and with latitude at two scales of resolution, local communities and regional species pools. We calculated 14 indices of diversity (species richness [three], evenness [four], dominance [three], and diversity [four]) from species abundance distributions for 32 intensively sampled local sites between 42.25° N and 24.12° S latitude. The species richness of each corresponding regional pool was estimated from published range maps. In general, the gradient of local species richness was less steep than the corresponding gradient of regional species richness; beta diversity in the tropics is greater than that for temperate communities. All aspects of diversity at the local scale did not vary with latitude in the same manner. The latitudinal gradient in species diversity of local communities was primarily a consequence of the corresponding gradient in species richness. Local richness increased and became more variable with decreasing latitude. In contrast, species evenness did not vary in a systematic fashion with latitude. Although the absolute number of rare species in communities increased faster with latitude than did that of common species, both abundance classes proportionately increased with latitude in equivalent ways throughout the New World. In general, latitudinal variation at the community level was detected in diversity indices that were insensitive to the abundance of species. The dramatic increase in species richness at broad scales of resolution toward the tropics (gamma diversity) was as much a consequence of increased richness at the local level (alpha diversity) as it was a consequence of the latitudinal increase in species turnover among communities (beta diversity). Future theoretical research should examine the correlates of latitude that enhance differentiation among communities at low latitudes (i.e., those which enjoy high productivities). Conservation strategies based on assessments of diversity at coarse levels of resolution (gamma diversity) should be implemented with caution because beta diversity inflates regional estimates of diversity.},

However, the fossil record is not only incomplete but has inherent biases due to geological, physical, chemical and biological factors such that not all individuals or species are equally likely to be discovered at any point in time or space. In order to use the fossil record to reconstruct temporal dynamics of diversity, biased sampling must be explicitly taken into account. Here, we introduce an approach that utilizes the variation in the number of times each species is observed in the fossil record to estimate both sampling bias and true richness. We term our technique TRiPS (True Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model) and explore its robustness to violation of its assumptions via simulations before applying it to an empirical dataset. We then venture to estimate sampling bias and absolute species richness of dinosaurs in the geological stages of the Mesozoic. Using TRiPS, we present new estimates of species richness trajectories of the three major dinosaur clades; the sauropods, ornithischians and theropods, casting doubt on the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event and demonstrating that all dinosaur groups are subject to considerable sampling bias throughout the Mesozoic.},

The crania belong to both the genusAustralopithecus andHomo and provide a clear outline of hominid cranial evolution starting at more than 3 million years ago. Beginning withA. afarensis there is a clear increase in both absolute and relative brain size with every successive time period.H.s. neandertal has an absolutely and relatively smaller brain size (1412cc, E.Q.=5.6) than fossil modernH.s. sapiens (1487cc, E.Q.=5.9). Three evolutionary models of hominid brain evolution were tested: gradualism, punctuated equilibrium, and a mixed model using both gradualism and punctuated equilibrium. Both parametric and non-parametric analyses show a clear trend toward increasing brain size withH. erectus and a possible relationship within archaicH. sapiens. An evolutionary stasis in cranial capacity could not be refuted for all other taxa. Consequently, the mixed model appears to more fully explain hominid cranial capacity evolution. However, taxonomic decisions could directly compromise the possibility of testing the evolutionary mechanisms hypothesized to be operating in hominid brain expansion.},

If the distribution of fossil occurrence horizons is controlled by a Poisson random variable, the distribution of gap length frequencies will be exponential. An exponential model of gap length frequencies allows us to place confidence intervals on the expected extent of taxon range zones and on the observed order of any two biostratigraphic events. By examining all pairs of biostratigraphic events, it becomes possible to estimate the corresponding sequence of biologic events. Sequences of biologic events determined in this fashion may be compared with the results of other quantitative biostratigraphic techniques. The utility of an exponential model assumes that (1) the distribution of fossil occurrence horizons in taxon range zones is random, and (2) sampling is random. If these assumptions are violated, an exponential model of gap length frequencies should not be used to place confidence intervals on the expected endpoints of taxon range zones. However, the problem of nonrandom sampling may be alleviated through additional collecting.},

	abstract = {The post-blackening (PB) approach is introduced for modeling annual streamflows that exhibit significant dependence. This is a hybrid approach that blends a simple low-order, linear parametric model with the moving block resampling scheme. Empirical simulations performed using known hypothetical nonlinear parametric models, show that the hybrid model gains significantly by utilizing the merits of both the parametric model and the moving block resampling scheme (nonparametric). Following this, the performance of the PB model is tested with four annual streamflow records with complex dependence, drawn from different parts of the world. The results from these examples show that the PB approach exhibits a better performance in terms of preservation of summary statistics, dependence structure, marginal distribution, and drought characteristics of historical streamflows, compared to low-order linear parametric models and model based resampling schemes (nonparametric model). Furthermore, it offers flexibility to the modeler and is also simple to implement on a personal computer. This hybrid approach seems to offer considerable scope for improvement in hydrologic time series modeling and its applications to water resources planning.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT One of the most common explanations for an increase in species richness with productivity is what we have dubbed the “More Individuals Hypothesis.” According to this hypothesis, more productive sites can support higher total abundances and, since species richness is an increasing function of total abundance, so will it be of productivity. This hypothesis assumes that communities are limited by productivity. We tested the More Individuals Hypothesis using the detritivorous aquatic insect communities of tree holes. When tree holes with varying levels of productivity (debris amount) were allowed to be colonized (through oviposition), more productive tree holes did have more species but not more individuals. Neither was total energy use strictly proportional to productivity. Only in communities forced to disassemble through productivity reductions were the predictions of the More Individuals Hypothesis satisfied. Ovipositing adults may prefer productive tree holes not because they contain more resources but because they are anticipated to be less likely to dry out. In tree holes, and more generally, the More Individuals Hypothesis is an insufficient explanation for increases in species richness with productivity because it neither accounts for the different processes of local coloni zation and extinction nor allows body size to correlate with extinction risk.},

	abstract = {Species have survived for long intervals of geological time relative to the intervals during which major adaptive transitions have occurred. A large sample of well documented Early Eocene lineages of mammals reveals no example of significant phyletic evolution over spans of 2-3 Myr. Despite this great stability of established species, at least 20 families and hundreds of genera evolved during this interval, which lasted only about 5 Myr. For many groups of marine invertebrates, median species diversity approaches or exceeds 10 Myr. Once established, a typical lineage of eukaryotic animals or plants that has survived for 105-107 generations has undergone little change in form. This characteristic stability has not been predicted by population genetic theory. The implication of the stability of established species is that most evolutionary change occurs rapidly, in local populations. Because the direction taken by rapidly divergent speciation is variable and only weakly predictable for large segments of phylogeny, macroevolution is largely decoupled from microevolution. Thus macroevolution, which encompasses change in the compositions of higher taxa brought about by the appearance and disappearance of species, is a valid subdivision of evolutionary science.},

	abstract = {Abstract According to when they attained high diversity, major taxa of marine animals have been clustered into three groups, the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern Faunas. Because the Cambrian Fauna was a relatively minor component of the total fauna after mid-Ordovician time, the Phanerozoic history of marine animal diversity is largely a matter of the fates of the Paleozoic and Modern Faunas. The fact that most late Cenozoic genera belong to taxa that have been radiating for tens of millions of years indicates that the post-Paleozoic increase in diversity indicated by fossil data is real, rather than an artifact of improvement of the fossil record toward the present. Assuming that ecological crowding produced the so-called Paleozoic plateau for family diversity, various workers have used the logistic equation of ecology to model marine animal diversification as damped exponential increase. Several lines of evidence indicate that this procedure is inappropriate. A plot of the diversity of marine animal genera through time provides better resolution than the plot for families and has a more jagged appearance. Generic diversity generally increased rapidly during the Paleozoic, except when set back by pulses of mass extinction. In fact, an analysis of the history of the Paleozoic Fauna during the Paleozoic Era reveals no general correlation between rate of increase for this fauna and total marine animal diversity. Furthermore, realistically scaled logistic simulations do not mimic the empirical pattern. In addition, it is difficult to imagine how some fixed limit for diversity could have persisted throughout the Paleozoic Era, when the ecological structure of the marine ecosystem was constantly changing. More fundamentally, the basic idea that competition can set a limit for marine animal diversity is incompatible with basic tenets of marine ecology: predation, disturbance, and vagaries of recruitment determine local population sizes for most marine species. Sparseness of predators probably played a larger role than weak competition in elevating rates of diversification during the initial (Ordovician) radiation of marine animals and during recoveries from mass extinctions. A plot of diversification against total diversity for these intervals yields a band of points above the one representing background intervals, and yet this band also displays no significant trend (if the two earliest intervals of the initial Ordovician are excluded as times of exceptional evolutionary innovation). Thus, a distinctive structure characterized the marine ecosystem during intervals of evolutionary radiation—one in which rates of diversification were exceptionally high and yet increases in diversity did not depress rates of diversification. Particular marine taxa exhibit background rates of origination and extinction that rank similarly when compared with those of other taxa. Rates are correlated in this way because certain heritable traits influence probability of speciation and probability of extinction in similar ways. Background rates of origination and extinction were depressed during the late Paleozoic ice age for all major marine invertebrate taxa, but remained correlated. Also, taxa with relatively high background rates of extinction experienced exceptionally heavy losses during biotic crises because background rates of extinction were intensified in a multiplicative manner; decimation of a large group of taxa of this kind in the two Permian mass extinctions established their collective identity as the Paleozoic Fauna. Characteristic rates of origination and extinction for major taxa persisted from Paleozoic into post-Paleozoic time. Because of the causal linkage between rates of origination and extinction, pulses of extinction tended to drag down overall rates of origination as well as overall rates of extinction by preferentially eliminating higher taxa having relatively high background rates of extinction. This extinction/origination ratchet depressed turnover rates for the residual Paleozoic Fauna during the Mesozoic Era. A decline of this fauna's extinction rate to approximately that of the Modern Fauna accounts for the nearly equal fractional losses experienced by the two faunas in the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction. Viewed arithmetically, the fossil record indicates slow diversification for the Modern Fauna during Paleozoic time, followed by much more rapid expansion during Mesozoic and Cenozoic time. When viewed more appropriately as depicting geometric—or exponential—increase, however, the empirical pattern exhibits no fundamental secular change: the background rate of increase for the Modern Fauna—the fauna that dominated post-Paleozoic marine diversity—simply persisted, reflecting the intrinsic origination and extinction rates of constituent taxa. Persistence of this overall background rate supports other evidence that the empirical record of diversification for marine animal life since Paleozoic time represents actual exponential increase. This enduring rate makes it unnecessary to invoke environmental change to explain the post-Paleozoic increase of marine diversity. Because of the resilience of intrinsic rates, an empirically based simulation that entails intervals of exponential increase for the Paleozoic and Modern Faunas, punctuated by mass extinctions, yields a pattern that is remarkably similar to the empirical pattern. It follows that marine animal genera and species will continue to diversify exponentially long into the future, barring disruption of the marine ecosystem by human-induced or natural environmental changes.},

This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species’ presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.},

In the latter case, however, there is no consensus over the respective groupings, and which of the two includes OH 7, the 1.8-million-year-old H. habilis holotype7. This partial skull and hand from Olduvai Gorge remains pivotal to evaluating the early evolution of the Homo lineage, and by priority names one or other of the two taxa. However, the distorted preservation of the diagnostically important OH 7 mandible has hindered attempts to compare this specimen with other fossils8,9. Here we present a virtual reconstruction of the OH 7 mandible, and compare it to other early Homo fossils. The reconstructed mandible is remarkably primitive, with a long and narrow dental arcade more similar to Australopithecus afarensis than to the derived parabolic arcades of Homo sapiens or H. erectus. We find that this shape variability is not consistent with a single species of early Homo. Importantly, the jaw morphology of OH 7 is incompatible with fossils assigned to Homo rudolfensis8 and with the A.L. 666-1 Homo maxilla. The latter is morphologically more derived than OH 7 but 500,000 years older10, suggesting that the H. habilis lineage originated before 2.3 million years ago, thus marking deep-rooted species diversity in the genus Homo. We also reconstructed the parietal bones of OH 7 and estimated its endocranial volume. At between 729 and 824 ml it is larger than any previously published value, and emphasizes the near-complete overlap in brain size among species of early Homo. Our results clarify the H. habilis hypodigm, but raise questions about its phylogenetic relationships. Differences between species of early Homo appear to be characterized more by gnathic diversity than by differences in brain size, which was highly variable within all taxa.},

The best known early hominin species, H. habilis and H. erectus, have often been interpreted as time-successive segments of a single anagenetic evolutionary lineage. The case for this was strengthened by the discovery of small early Pleistocene hominin crania from Dmanisi in Georgia that apparently provide evidence of morphological continuity between the two taxa. Here we describe two new cranial fossils from the Koobi Fora Formation, east of Lake Turkana in Kenya, that have bearing on the relationship between species of early Homo. A partial maxilla assigned to H. habilis reliably demonstrates that this species survived until later than previously recognized, making an anagenetic relationship with H. erectus unlikely. The discovery of a particularly small calvaria of H. erectus indicates that this taxon overlapped in size with H. habilis, and may have shown marked sexual dimorphism. The new fossils confirm the distinctiveness of H. habilis and H. erectus, independently of overall cranial size, and suggest that these two early taxa were living broadly sympatrically in the same lake basin for almost half a million years.},

Such graphs of interaction are, in fact, shared by a number of biological and technological networks, which have been shown to display a very high homeostasis against random removals of nodes. Here, we analyse the responses of these ecological graphs to both random and selective perturbations (directed against the most–connected species). Our results suggest that ecological networks are very robust against random removals but can be extremely fragile when selective attacks are used. These observations have important consequences for biodiversity dynamics and conservation issues, current estimations of extinction rates and the relevance and definition of keystone species.},

A striking result is that the species-area relationship derived from small-scale experimental studies correctly scales up to natural aquatic ecosystems. These results significantly broaden our knowledge of the effects of island size on biodiversity and also confirm the relevance of experimentally derived data to the analysis and understanding of larger-scale ecological patterns. In addition, they confirm that patterns in microbial diversity are strongly consistent with those that have been repeatedly reported in the literature for macroorganisms.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic traits mediate organisms' interactions with the environment and determine how they affect and are affected by their biotic and abiotic milieu. Thus, dispersion of trait values, or functional diversity (FD) of a community can offer insights into processes driving community assembly. For example, underdispersion of FD suggests that habitat “filtering” of species with unfavorable trait values restricts the species that can exist in a particular habitat, while even spacing of FD suggests that interspecific competition, or biotic “sorting,” discourages the coexistence of species with similar trait values. Since assembly processes are expected to vary as a function of spatial scale, we should also expect patterns of FD to reflect scale dependence in filtering and biotic sorting. Here we present the concept of the functional-diversity–area relationship (FAR), which is similar to the species–area relationship but plots a measure of phenotypic trait diversity as a function of spatial scale. We develop a set of null model tests that discriminate between FARs generated predominantly by filtering or biotic sorting and indicate the scales at which these effects are pronounced. The utility of the FAR for addressing long-standing issues in ecology is illustrated with several examples. A multi-scale examination of FD and its pattern relative to null expectations provides an important tool for ecologists interested in understanding the scale dependence of community assembly processes.},

Discussed here are some of the consequences of using a power function (and the resulting logarithmic transformation of data) to describe allometric trends, the dependence on correlation coefficients as a measure of strength of association, and the assumptions underlying use of empirical data to determine the relative size of structures.

We assemble criteria for an appropriate index for the evenness of a biological sample. The most important criterion is that evenness should be independent of species richness. Twelve previously proposed indices and variants are considered, and two apparently new indices. Four indices are recommended as joint best buys: A) If symmetry between minor and abundant species is not important, or if it is required that the index be less affected by minor species: 1) If it is essential that the index be able to reach a minimum of zero with any particular number of species, or if the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is important: E$_{\textrm{1/D}}$ (based on a common form of Simpson's index). 2) If good mid-range behaviour is desired: E$^{\textrm{′}}$ (proposed by Camargo). B) If equal sensitivity to minor and abundant species is required: 1) If the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is not important, the clear winner is: E$_{\textrm{Q}}$ (a new index). 2) If the shape is important: E$_{\textrm{var}}$ (another new index).

We use phylogenetic analysis to gain a new perspective on the subject. Using 69 traits, we construct a series of 12 complexes, each with a defining polarized morphocline. Four mutually exclusive cladograms are derived from these complexes, the most parsimonious of which implies that Homo habilis and A. robustus/boisei are more closely related to each other than either is to A. africanus and that these three species form a distinct evolutionary group relative to the more primitive A. afarensis. We advocate a phylogeny wherein A. afarensis is ancestral to A. africanus, which is in turn ancestral to A. robustus/boisei and H. habilis. We believe that the evolutionary transition from Australopithecus to Homo involved reduction in the size of the chewing teeth and associated traits leading to a unique derived condition in H. habilis that superficially resembles the primitive condition of A. afarensis. Five other current phylogenies are treated as critiques of this one.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Concern over species declines has prompted researchers to use historical data as a basis for comparison with present-day information from the same sites to assess changes in presence/absence distributions. A review of the literature revealed that these resurveys typically lasted for 1 or 2 years, and many were based on museum records or other data relying on known historical presences. Using data on nine amphibian species from a set of 32 ponds at the E. S. George Reserve ( ESGR ) in Michigan, we evaluated the importance of the duration of a resurvey and the type of historical data used ( information on historical presences and absences vs. historical presences only ). We compared data we collected between 1996 and 2000 with information from the same ponds collected between 1967 and 1974. By systematically degrading the 1996–2000 data, we determined that a resurvey lasting 1 year would yield an estimated 45\% decline in the number of presences, whereas a resurvey lasting 2 years would yield an estimated 28\% decline. In contrast, a 5-year resurvey would yield an estimated 3\% decline in the number of presences. In addition, when our historical data were limited to known presences in the past, even a 5-year resurvey yielded an estimated 30\% decline in the number of presences. Our results suggest that estimates of decline and distributional change can be extremely sensitive to the duration of resurvey effort and the type of historical data used. The pattern we found in analyses of ESGR data is echoed in published studies in which multiple-year resurveys tended to yield smaller estimates of decline than single-year resurveys. Based on our findings, we suggest that future resurveys extend for long enough to estimate the value of additional data and that geographic scales of inference be chosen based on the amount and quality of historical information.},

	abstract = {A model of the competition between two species is developed which is based on the work of Cohen (1970) and Levins and Culver (1971) and which considers the effect of competition on the colonization and extinction rates of the two species. The results are that in some cases it is possible for one species to exclude another species from a geographic region, but there is no possibility of a 'priority effect' where the first species in the region can always exclude the other. Thus the equilibrium level of each species is determined by the parameters of the system and not by the initial conditions. Also, it is possible for two similar species to coexist in a region. A predator can increase the extinction rate of each species and, in some cases, permit coexistence where it would otherwise not be possible.},

	abstract = {Habitat modification can homogenize biological communities. Beta diversity analyses provide key information for understanding biotic homogenization, especially given recent conceptual and methodological advances. Here, we investigated if landscape modification was associated with taxonomic homogenization in 32 stream insect communities from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We investigated: (1) if the way we defined landscape affected our estimates of beta diversity; (2) to what extent changes in species composition versus relative abundance caused the observed homogenization; and (3) if environmental heterogeneity among modified habitats influenced homogenization. We detected taxonomic homogenization caused by landscape modification only when we used refined landscape categorizations and abundance-based diversity measures. For forested streams, changes in relative abundance rather than absolute taxonomic composition increased the biological variation. Forested streams were generally more heterogeneous, with a variable set of abundant genera; by contrast, non-forested streams were more homogeneous, with the same set of genera being more or less abundant. We suggest that landscape modification by agriculture, pasture, and silviculture reduces beta diversity by limiting the colonization of potential species, and, ultimately, causing taxonomic homogenization. Studies investigating biotic homogenization should include multiple dissimilarity measures representing changes in relative species abundance and community composition.},

Here, we extend the adaptive landscape framework to ecological sorting of multidimensional phenotypes across environments and discuss how two analytical approaches can be used to quantify fitness as a function of the interaction between the phenotype and the environment. We encourage ecologists to consider how phenotypic integration will constrain species responses to environmental change.},

The dome has yielded nearly 80 Homo erectus fossils, around 50 of which have known findspots. With a hornblende 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 1.66 ± 0.04 mega-annum (Ma) reportedly associated with two fossils [Swisher, C.C., III, Curtis, G. H., Jacob, T., Getty, A. G., Suprijo, A. \& Widiasmoro (1994) Science 263, 1118–1121), the dome offers evidence that early Homo dispersed to East Asia during the earliest Pleistocene. Unfortunately, the hornblende pumice was sampled at Jokotingkir Hill, a central locality with complex lithostratigraphic deformation and dubious specimen provenance. To address the antiquity of Sangiran H. erectus more systematically, we investigate the sedimentary framework and hornblende 40Ar/39Ar age for volcanic deposits in the southeast quadrant of the dome. In this sector, Bapang (Kabuh) sediments have their largest exposure, least deformation, and most complete tephrostratigraphy. At five locations, we identify a sequence of sedimentary cycles in which H. erectus fossils are associated with epiclastic pumice. From sampled pumice, eight hornblende separates produced 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages ranging from 1.51 ± 0.08 Ma at the Bapang/Sangiran Formation contact, to 1.02 ± 0.06 Ma, at a point above the hominin-bearing sequence. The chronological sequence of 40Ar/39Ar ages follows stratigraphic order across the southeast quadrant. An intermediate level yielding four nearly complete crania has an age of about 1.25 Ma.},

	abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence–absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the “FD” R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) plays a potentially important role in determining functional community composition across environmental gradients. However, the importance of ITV varies greatly among studies, and we lack a coherent understanding of the contexts under which to expect a high versus low contribution of ITV to trait-environment matching among communities. Here we first elaborate a novel conceptual framework posing specific hypotheses and predictions about the environmental and ecological contexts underlying the contribution of ITV to community trait turnover.  We then empirically test these predictions in understory herbaceous plant communities in a montane environment, for 3 functional traits (flowering phenology, specific leaf area and height). We found that different components of trait variation mapped onto different environmental axes, specifically reporting a greater contribution of ITV along non-climatic axes (e.g., soil properties, light) than along the main climatic axis (i.e., elevation), as predicted by the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity (a major source of ITV) is greatest in response to conditions varying at a small spatial scale. Based on a variant of the niche-variation hypothesis, we predicted that the importance of ITV would be greatest in the lowest-diversity portion of the elevational gradient (i.e., at high elevation), but this prediction was not supported. Finally, the generally strong intraspecific responses to the gradient observed across species did not necessarily give rise to a high contribution of ITV (or vice versa) given: (a) an especially weak or strong response of a dominant species driving the community-level trend, (b) differences among species in the direction of trait-environment response cancelling out, or (c) relatively narrow portions of the gradient where individual species abundances were high enough to have an important impact on community-level trait means. Our research identifies contexts in which we can predict that local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity will play a relatively large role in mediating community-level trait responses to environmental change.},

Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems.},

	abstract = {Molecular clocks have been used to date the divergence of humans and chimpanzees for nearly four decades. Nonetheless, this date and its confidence interval remain to be firmly established. In an effort to generate a genomic view of the human–chimpanzee divergence, we have analyzed 167 nuclear protein-coding genes and built a reliable confidence interval around the calculated time by applying a multifactor bootstrap-resampling approach. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of neutral DNA substitutions show that the human–chimpanzee divergence is close to 20\% of the ape–Old World monkey (OWM) divergence. Therefore, the generally accepted range of 23.8–35 millions of years ago for the ape–OWM divergence yields a range of 4.98–7.02 millions of years ago for human–chimpanzee divergence. Thus, the older time estimates for the human–chimpanzee divergence, from molecular and paleontological studies, are unlikely to be correct. For a given the ape–OWM divergence time, the 95\% confidence interval of the human–chimpanzee divergence ranges from –12\% to 19\% of the estimated time. Computer simulations suggest that the 95\% confidence intervals obtained by using a multifactor bootstrap-resampling approach contain the true value with {\textgreater}95\% probability, whether deviations from the molecular clock are random or correlated among lineages. Analyses revealed that the use of amino acid sequence differences is not optimal for dating human–chimpanzee divergence and that the inclusion of additional genes is unlikely to narrow the confidence interval significantly. We conclude that tests of hypotheses about the timing of human–chimpanzee divergence demand more precise fossil-based calibrations.},

	abstract = {Aim  We examine patterns of temporal turnover of common species in avian assemblages in North America to test the hypothesis that changes in avian diversity structure observed in these assemblages were associated with the colonization of common species. Location  The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods  We measured temporal turnover from 1968 to 2003 for 547 avian species at 1673 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. We used the Euclidian distance between expected and observed presence/absence vectors and randomization tests to place species into two categories, common and not-common, and into three categories for common species: (1) always common, (2) common and colonizing, and (3) common and extirpated. We used these categories to identify species experiencing extreme colonization and extirpation events and to examine changes in species composition at BBS routes. We also determined how these patterns were associated with changes in species richness and changes in similarity in species composition. Results  Nine of the 547 species represented outliers, where the number of BBS routes colonized greatly exceeded the number extirpated; no species showed extreme values for extirpation. The nine species colonized BBS routes primarily in the upper Midwest and north-eastern United States. Presence of the nine species at BBS routes was correlated with increasing net gain in common species (difference between common colonized and common extirpated), higher levels of species richness and increasing species richness over time, more similar species compositions and increasing similarity over time, and a greater prevalence of common species over not-common species. The literature indicates that all nine species experienced some form of geographical range expansion during the time of the survey involving four elements: (1) introduction and invasion; (2) the ability to use human-altered environments, including habitats associated with agricultural, suburban, or urban areas; (3) intensive management activities, including habitat improvements and reintroductions and (4) the ability to use habitats formed through forest regeneration. These factors in combination point to anthropogenic activities and related land use histories as the primary drivers of change. One of the nine species colonized regions well outside its historic geographical range and the remaining eight species were native within the regions they colonized. Main conclusions  Our results suggest that a combination of anthropogenic activities promoted, within certain regions of North America, the geographical expansion of a limited number of common species that were native to those regions. These colonization events were correlated with changes in diversity structure, implying that large-scale diversity patterns were being influenced by anthropogenic activities. These changes can be characterized primarily by gains in species richness, an increased prevalence of common species, and more similar species compositions. Thus, using simple large-scale measures of diversity could be problematic if recent biogeographical patterns of species diversity are not considered. Specifically, using species richness or an indicator species to assess diversity could bias assessments towards common species whose populations have recently benefited through anthropogenic activities.},

We humans tend to believe that our cognitive skills are unique, not only in degree, but also in kind. The more closely we look at other species, however, the clearer it becomes that the difference is one of degree. Krupenye et al. show that three different species of apes are able to anticipate that others may have mistaken beliefs about a situation (see the Perspective by de Waal). The apes appear to understand that individuals have different perceptions about the world, thus overturning the human-only paradigm of the theory of mind.
Science, this issue p. 110; see also p. 39
Humans operate with a “theory of mind” with which they are able to understand that others’ actions are driven not by reality but by beliefs about reality, even when those beliefs are false. Although great apes share with humans many social-cognitive skills, they have repeatedly failed experimental tests of such false-belief understanding. We use an anticipatory looking test (originally developed for human infants) to show that three species of great apes reliably look in anticipation of an agent acting on a location where he falsely believes an object to be, even though the apes themselves know that the object is no longer there. Our results suggest that great apes also operate, at least on an implicit level, with an understanding of false beliefs.

Until recently, ecological traps were considered a kind of source–sink system, but source–sink theory does not model maladaptive habitat choice, and therefore cannot accurately represent ecological traps or predict their population-level consequences. Although recent models of ecological traps addressed this problem, they used patch-based models containing only two habitats that were very different from one another, but were internally homogeneous. These sorts of patch models may not apply to many real populations, and using them for populations in landscapes with mosaic or gradient habitat structures may be misleading. I developed models that treat source–sink dynamics and ecological traps as special cases of a single process, in which the attractiveness and quality of the habitat are separate variables that can be either positively or negatively related, and in which habitat quality varies continuously throughout the landscape. As expected, sinks are less detrimental to populations than ecological traps, in which preferential use of poor habitat elevates extinction risk. Furthermore, ecological traps may be undetected, and may even appear to be sources, when population sizes are large, but may still prevent recovery in spite of the availability of high-quality habitat when populations drop below threshold levels. Conservation biologists do not routinely consider the possibility that apparent sinks are actually traps, but since traps should be associated with the rapidly changing and novel habitat characteristics primarily produced by human activities, ecological traps should be considered an important and potentially widespread conservation concern.},

In this area, numerous fossiliferous localities have been estimated to date from the end of the Pleistocene, which have yielded abundant vertebrate fossil remains. Among the excavated fossils of terrestrial vertebrates, two extinct deer species, Cervus astylodon and Dicrocerus sp., are representative of the Late Pleistocene fauna of the Okinawa Islands. However, their ecological characteristics have been largely unknown to date. In the present study, we reconstructed the paleoecology of the deer species using mesowear and stable isotope analyses of tooth remains excavated from the Hananda-Gama Cave, Okinawa Island. Mesowear analysis estimates the properties of consumed food from the facet development of ungulate cheek teeth, with more abrasive diets (i.e., grass) resulting in more rounded cusps with a lower profile. Carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) reflects relative contribution of C3 (woody and most herbaceous plants) and C4 (grass growing in temperate to tropical regions) plants in diets, with the former showing lower δ13C values. Both extinct deer had sharp cusps with high profiles, which implied a significant amount of browse in diets. Our stable isotope analysis corroborated this: δ13C values were in the range of extant C3 feeders. Species ranges overlapped each other; however, C. astylodon had a wider range into the higher δ13C value range than Dicrocerus sp., which implied dietary niche differentiation between the two species. The dominance of C3 browse in their diet supports a hypothesis that hypsodont molar of C. astylodon was not an adaptive response to abrasive and wear-induced diet but correlated evolution with its elongated longevity, which was considered to be up to 26 years of age.},

Most nonhuman primate genomes generated to date have been “humanized” owing to their many gaps and the reliance on guidance by the reference human genome. To remove this humanizing effect, Kronenberg et al. generated and assembled long-read genomes of a chimpanzee, an orangutan, and two humans and compared them with a previously generated gorilla genome. This analysis recognized genomic structural variation specific to humans and particular ape lineages. Comparisons between human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids showed down-regulation of the expression of specific genes in humans, relative to chimpanzees, related to noncoding variation identified in this analysis.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding the genetic differences that make us human is a long-standing endeavor that requires the comprehensive discovery and comparison of all forms of genetic variation within great ape lineages.
RATIONALEThe varied quality and completeness of ape genomes have limited comparative genetic analyses. To eliminate this contiguity and quality disparity, we generated human and nonhuman ape genome assemblies without the guidance of the human reference genome. These new genome assemblies enable both coarse and fine-scale comparative genomic studies.
RESULTSWe sequenced and assembled two human, one chimpanzee, and one orangutan genome using high-coverage ({\textgreater}65x) single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing technology. We also sequenced more than 500,000 full-length complementary DNA samples from induced pluripotent stem cells to construct de novo gene models, increasing our knowledge of transcript diversity in each ape lineage. The new nonhuman ape genome assemblies improve gene annotation and genomic contiguity (by 30- to 500-fold), resulting in the identification of larger synteny blocks (by 22- to 74-fold) when compared to earlier assemblies. Including the latest gorilla genome, we now estimate that 83\% of the ape genomes can be compared in a multiple sequence alignment.We observe a modest increase in single-nucleotide variant divergence compared to previous genome analyses and estimate that 36\% of human autosomal DNA is subject to incomplete lineage sorting. We fully resolve most common repeat differences, including full-length retrotransposons such as the African ape-specific endogenous retroviral element PtERV1. We show that the spread of this element independently in the gorilla and chimpanzee lineage likely resulted from a founder element that failed to segregate to the human lineage because of incomplete lineage sorting.The improved sequence contiguity allowed a more systematic discovery of structural variation ({\textgreater}50 base pairs in length) (see the figure). We detected 614,186 ape deletions, insertions, and inversions, assigning each to specific ape lineages. Unbiased genome scaffolding (optical maps, bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization) led to the discovery of large, unknown complex inversions in gene-rich regions. Of the 17,789 fixed human-specific insertions and deletions, we focus on those of potential functional effect. We identify 90 that are predicted to disrupt genes and an additional 643 that likely affect regulatory regions, more than doubling the number of human-specific deletions that remove regulatory sequence in the human lineage. We investigate the association of structural variation with changes in human-chimpanzee brain gene expression using cerebral organoids as a proxy for expression differences. Genes associated with fixed structural variants (SVs) show a pattern of down-regulation in human radial glial neural progenitors, whereas human-specific duplications are associated with up-regulated genes in human radial glial and excitatory neurons (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONThe improved ape genome assemblies provide the most comprehensive view to date of intermediate-size structural variation and highlight several dozen genes associated with structural variation and brain-expression differences between humans and chimpanzees. These new references will provide a stepping stone for the completion of great ape genomes at a quality commensurate with the human reference genome and, ultimately, an understanding of the genetic differences that make us human. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6393/eaar6343/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint SMRT assemblies and SV analyses.(Top) Contiguity of the de novo assemblies. (Bottom, left to right) For each ape, SVdetection was done against the human reference genome as represented by a dot plot of an inversion). Human-specific SVs, identified by comparing ape SVs and population genotyping (0/0, homozygous reference),were compared to single-cell gene expression differences [range: low (dark blue) to high (dark red)] in primary and organoid tissues. Each heatmap row is a gene that intersects an insertion or deletion (green), duplication (cyan), or inversion (light green).
Genetic studies of human evolution require high-quality contiguous ape genome assemblies that are not guided by the human reference. We coupled long-read sequence assembly and full-length complementary DNA sequencing with a multiplatform scaffolding approach to produce ab initio chimpanzee and orangutan genome assemblies. By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome assemblies and a gorilla genome assembly, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great ape genetic variation ranging from single– to mega–base pair–sized variants. We identified {\textasciitilde}17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.
Analysis of long-read great ape and human genomes identifies human-specific changes affecting brain gene expression.

Yet much remains to be discovered about the functions of this key brain region, and new evidence from functional neuroimaging and clinical neuropsychology is affording new insights into the different functions of the human orbitofrontal cortex. We review the neuroanatomical and neuropsychological literature on the human orbitofrontal cortex, and propose two distinct trends of neural activity based on a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. One is a mediolateral distinction, whereby medial orbitofrontal cortex activity is related to monitoring the reward value of many different reinforcers, whereas lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity is related to the evaluation of punishers which may lead to a change in ongoing behaviour. The second is a posterior-anterior distinction with more complex or abstract reinforcers (such as monetary gain and loss) represented more anteriorly in the orbitofrontal cortex than simpler reinforcers such as taste or pain. Finally, we propose new neuroimaging methods for obtaining further evidence on the localisation of function in the human orbitofrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {Time-averaging makes events that happened at different times appear to be synchronous in the geological record. It can generate overcompleteness by concentrating objects (e.g., fossils, clasts) from a longer time interval into a unit that formed during a shorter interval. Time-averaging results both from extrinsic agents (e.g., vertical mixing, condensation, analytical pooling of data) and the intrinsic properties of the fossilized objects (preservational potential and abundance). Variation in intrinsic and extrinsic factors results in disharmonious time-aver aging: different taxa preserved together may be time-averaged over different time-scales. Because extrinsic and intrinsic factors vary in time and space, the geological record is characterized by vertical and lateral variations in time-averaging. The importance of time-averaging depends on the time-aver aging threshold, which is determined by the time-scale of the process of interest. Significant time-aver aging occurs when the scale of temporal mixing exceeds the time-scale of the process. Insignificant time-averaging occurs under opposite conditions. Accordingly, the consequences of time-averaging can be viewed as a function of the time-averaging threshold. Insignificant time-averaging eliminates noise by erasing short-term fluctuations and enhancing persistent signals. Significant time-averaging reduces resolution by the cumulative averaging of short-term signals. It may also generate false patterns by making diachronous events appear to be synchronous.},

First, we evaluated the relative contribution of range-restricted and widespread species on the patterns of species richness and endemism. Second, we analysed the impact of range size on the predictive value of commonly used predictor variables. Species sequences were produced arranging species according to their range size in ascending, descending, and random order. Correlations between the cumulative species richness patterns of these sequences and environmental predictors were performed in order to analyse the effect of range size. Despite the high proportion of rare species, patterns of species richness were found to be dominated by a minority of widespread species (∼20\%) which contained 80\% of the spatial information. Climatic factors related to energy and water availability and productivity accounted for much of the spatial variation of species richness of widespread species. In contrast, species richness of range-restricted species was to a larger extent determined by topographical complexity. However, this effect was much more difficult to detect due to a dominant influence of widespread species. Although the strength of different environmental predictors changed with spatial scale, the general patterns and trends proved to be relatively stabile at the examined grain sizes. Our results highlight the difficulties to approximate causal explanations for the occurrence of a majority of species and to distinguish between contemporary climatic factors and history.},

	abstract = {abstract: Inequalities in reproductive success or resource acquisition are fundamental to evolution and population ecology. There is, however, no unique way to measure inequality. We review 21 measures used to quantify it and clarify the conceptual difference between inequality and skewness. In two very different families of distributions, all indices except three give higher values for more unequal distributions of resources, although some of them are poor at distinguishing between similar inequality values. When applied correctly by testing against a null hypothesis of no inequality among individuals, most indices can therefore be used to detect deviations from randomness, but with varying ease as most lack statistical tables and rely on resampling techniques instead. As an example to test the performance of the 21 indices, we used each index to analyze 71 data sets of unequal mating success in leks. In pairwise comparisons, 24\% of the indices fail to show a positive intercorrelation. This reflects differences in how indices incorporate variation in the number of competitors and mean acquisition of the resource. All indices are sensitive to these aspects if inequality is measured in data arising from different distributions. These results illustrate the general conclusion that a unique “best” solution is not available; each measure presents its own definition of inequality. The choice of an inequality index requires specifying the null expectations and interpreting deviating values in relation to the biological question being addressed. This means, for example, considering individual male mating success in the context of lekking or relating the mass distribution of individual plants to alternative hypotheses about competition in plant population ecology. When sample sizes vary, testing robustness by using several measures is advisable.},

	abstract = {Few paleontological studies of species distribution in time and space have adequately considered the effects of sample size. Most species occur very infrequently, and therefore sample size effects may be large relative to the faunal patterns reported. Examination of 10 carefully compiled large data sets (each more than 1,000 occurrences) reveals that the species-occurrence frequency distribution of each fits the log series distribution well and therefore sample size effects can be predicted. Results show that, if the materials used in assembling a large data set are resampled, as many as 25\% of the species will not be found a second time even if both samples are of the same size. If the two samples are of unequal size, then the larger sample may have as many as 70\% unique species and the smaller sample no unique species. The implications of these values are important to studies of species richness, origination, and extinction patterns, and biogeographic phenomena such as endemism or province boundaries. I provide graphs showing the predicted sample size effects for a range of data set size, species richness, and relative data size. For data sets that do not fit the log series distribution well, I provide example calculations and equations which are usable without a large computer. If these graphs or equations are not used, then I suggest that species which occur infrequently be eliminated from consideration. Studies in which sample size effects are not considered should include sample size information in sufficient detail that other workers might make their own evaluation of observed faunal patterns.},

	abstract = {New local/regional climatic data were compared with floral and faunal records from central Patagonia to investigate how faunas evolve in the context of local and global climate. Oxygen isotope compositions of mammal fossils between c. 43 and 21 Ma suggest a nearly constant mean annual temperature of 16 ± 3 °C, consistent with leaf physiognomic and sea surface studies that imply temperatures of 16-18 °C. Carbon isotopes in tooth enamel track atmospheric δ13C, but with a positive deviation at 27.2 Ma, and a strong negative deviation at 21 Ma. Combined with paleosol characteristics and reconstructed Leaf Area Indices (rLAI), these trends suggest aridification from 45 Ma (c. 1200 mm/yr) to 43 Ma (c. 450 mm/yr), with quasi-constant MAP until at least 31 Ma, and increases to {\textasciitilde} 800 mm/yr by 21 Ma. Comparable MAP through most of the sequence is consistent with relatively constant floral compositions, rLAI, and leaf physiognomy. Abundance of palms reflects relatively dry-adapted lineages and greater drought tolerance under higher pCO2. Pedogenic carbonate isotopes imply low pCO2 = 430 ± 300 ppmv at the initiation of the Eocene-Oligocene climatic transition. Arid conditions in Patagonia during the late Eocene through Oligocene provided dust to the Southern Ocean, enhancing productivity of silicifiers, drawdown of atmospheric CO2, and protracted global cooling. As the Antarctic Circumpolar Current formed and Earth cooled, wind speeds increased across Patagonia, providing more dust in a positive climate feedback. High tooth crowns (hypsodonty) and ever-growing teeth (hypselodonty) in notoungulates evolved slowly and progressively over 20 Ma after initiation of relatively dry environments through natural selection in response to dust ingestion. A Ratchet evolutionary model may explain protracted evolution of hypsodonty, in which small variations in climate or dust delivery in an otherwise static environment drive small morphological shifts that accumulate slowly over geologic time.},

It has been pointed out that there are grounds for questioning the assignment of the Broken Hill and Saldanha specimens (lumped here and elsewhere as Rhodesian man) to Homo erectus2 and few authors would agree that they can be assigned to any modern race, but most have accepted their Upper Pleistocene date. In this note I point out recent evidence that these specimens are in fact far older.},

	abstract = {Trade-offs among species’ ecological interactions is a pervasive explanation for species coexistence. The traits associated with trade-offs are typically measured to mechanistically explain species coexistence at a single spatial scale. However, species potentially interact at multiple scales and this may be reflected in the traits among coexisting species. I quantified species’ ecological traits associated with the trade-offs expected at both local (competitive ability and predator tolerance) and regional (competitive ability and colonization rate) community scales. The most common species (four protozoa and a rotifer) from the middle trophic level of a pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) inquiline community were used to link species traits to previously observed patterns of species diversity and abundance. Traits associated with trade-offs (competitive ability, predator tolerance, and colonization rate) and other ecological traits (size, growth rate, and carrying capacity) were measured for each of the focal species. Traits were correlated with one another with a negative relationship indicative of a trade-off. Protozoan and rotifer species exhibited a negative relationship between competitive ability and predator tolerance, indicative of coexistence at the local community scale. There was no relationship between competitive ability and colonization rate. Size, growth rate, and carrying capacity were correlated with each other and the trade-off traits: Size was related to both competitive ability and predator tolerance, but growth rate and carrying capacity were correlated with predator tolerance. When partial correlations were conducted controlling for size, growth rate and carrying capacity, the trade-offs largely disappeared. These results imply that body size is the trait that provides the basis for ecological interactions and trade-offs. Altogether, this study showed that the examination of species’ traits in the context of coexistence at different scales can contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying community structure.},

Compensatory dynamics may be produced by negative interactions among species, such that the decrease in abundance of a species releases the suppression of another species and allows it to increase. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in Trout Lake, Wisconsin, USA, to test the hypothesis that compensatory shifts in species abundances play a role in overall planktonic community response to pH perturbation. In 2000-L mesocosms over a period of six weeks, we contrasted a control treatment with two acidified treatments (press, sustained pH = 4.7; and pulse, alternating pH = 4.7 and ambient pH). In the acidified treatments, we saw changes in abundance of the major zooplankton and phytoplankton species, but we observed few cases of compensatory dynamics. Nonetheless, when present, compensatory dynamics could be strong. Analyses using autoregressive models revealed negative interactions among species that could potentially lead to compensatory dynamics. However, this potential for compensatory dynamics was not realized in cases where all species were sensitive to the pH perturbations. Therefore, compensatory dynamics that buffer community responses to perturbations may be limited in communities in which many species are sensitive to the perturbation.},

Klein’s innovative approach while showing how cumulative discoveries and analyses over the past ten years have significantly refined our knowledge of human evolution. Klein chronicles the evolution of people from the earliest primates through the emergence of fully modern humans within the past 200,000 years. His comprehensive treatment stresses recent advances in knowledge, including, for example, ever more abundant evidence that fully modern humans originated in Africa and spread from there, replacing the Neanderthals in Europe and equally archaic people in Asia. With its coverage of both the fossil record and the archaeological record over the 2.5 million years for which both are available, The Human Career demonstrates that human morphology and behavior evolved together. Throughout the book, Klein presents evidence for alternative points of view, but does not hesitate to make his own position clear. In addition to outlining the broad pattern of human evolution, The Human Career details the kinds of data that support it. For the third edition, Klein has added numerous tables and a fresh citation system designed to enhance readability, especially for students. He has also included more than fifty new illustrations to help lay readers grasp the fossils, artifacts, and other discoveries on which specialists rely. With abundant references and hundreds of images, charts, and diagrams, this new edition is unparalleled in its usefulness for teaching human evolution.},

Here we show that selection acting on individual organisms generally favors larger body size. We performed an analysis of the strength of directional selection on size compared with other quantitative traits by evaluating 854 selection estimates from 42 studies of contemporaneous natural populations. For size, more than 79\% of selection estimates exceed zero, whereas for other morphological traits positive and negative values are similar in frequency. The selective advantage of increased size occurs for traits implicated in both natural selection (e.g., differences in survival) and sexual selection (e.g., differences in mating success). The predominance of positive directional selection on size within populations could translate into a macroevolutionary trend toward increased size and thereby explain Cope's rule.},

	abstract = {Abstract Gene flow from the center of a species' range can stymie adaptation at the periphery and prevent the range from expanding outward. We study this process using simple models that track both demography and the evolution of a quantitative trait in a population that is continuously distributed in space. Stabilizing selection acts on the trait and favors an optimum phenotype that changes linearly across the habitat. One of three outcomes is possible: the species will become extinct, expand to fill all of the available habitat, or be confined to a limited range in which it is sufficiently adapted to allow population growth. When the environment changes rapidly in space, increased migration inhibits local adaptation and so decreases the species' total population size. Gene flow can cause enough maladaptation that the peripheral half of a species' range acts as a demographic sink. The trait's genetic variance has little effect on species persistence or the size of the range when gene flow is sufficiently strong to keep population densities far below the carrying capacity throughout the range, but it can increase the range width and population size of an abundant species. Under some conditions, a small parameter change can dramatically shift the balance between gene flow and local adaptation, allowing a species with a limited range to suddenly expand to fill all the available habitat.},

	abstract = {We compiled a database of microevolution on contemporary time scales in nature (47 source articles; 30 animal species), comprising 2649 evolutionary rates in darwins (proportional change per million years) and 2151 evolutionary rates in haldanes (standard deviations per generation). Here we demonstrate how quantitative rate measures can provide general insights into patterns and processes of evolution. The frequency distribution of evolutionary rates was approximately log-normal, with many slow rates and few fast rates. Net selection intensities estimated from haldanes were on average lower than selection intensities commonly measured directly in natural populations. This difference suggests that natural selection could easily accomplish observed microevolution but that the intensities of selection typically measured in nature are rarely maintained for long (otherwise observed evolutionary rates would be higher). Traits closely associated with fitness (life history traits) appear to evolve at least as fast as traits less closely tied to fitness (morphology). The magnitude of evolutionary difference increased with the length of the time interval, particularly when maximum rates from a given study were considered. This pattern suggests a general underlying tendency toward increasing evolutionary diversification with time. However, evolutionary rates also tended to decrease with time, perhaps because longer time intervals average increasingly disparate rates over time, or because evolution slows when populations approach new optima or as genetic variation is depleted. In combination, our results suggest that macroevolutionary transitions may ultimately arise through microevolution occasionally ‘writ large’ but are perhaps temporally characterized by microevolution ‘writ in fits and starts’.},

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients {\textbar}β{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection on morphological and on life‐history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of {\textbar}β{\textbar} for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients {\textbar}γ{\textbar} were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

	abstract = {The Hadar site in Ethiopia is a prolific source of hominid fossils attributed to the species Australopithecus afarensis, which spans the period 3.4–3.0 million years (myr) in the Sidi Hakoma, Denen Dora and lower Kada Hadar Members of the Hadar Formation. Since 1992 a major focus of field work conducted at Hadar has centered on sediments younger than 3.0 myr, comprising the bulk of the Kada Hadar Member. Witnessing the rise of the “robust” Australopithecus clade(s), the origin of Homo, and the first record of lithic artifacts, the period between 3.0 and 2.0 myr is strategically vital for paleoanthropology. However, in eastern Africa it is a particularly poorly sampled temporal interval. This paper provides a detailed comparative description of a hominid maxilla with partial dentition found at Hadar in 1994. The specimen, A.L. 666-1, derives from a lithic artifact–bearing horizon high in the Kada Hadar Member, 0.8 m below the BKT-3 tephra, dated by the 40Ar/39Ar method to 2.33 ± 0.07 myr. Our preliminary investigation of the hominid specimen showed unambiguous affinities with early representatives of the Homo clade (Kimbel et al. [1996] J. Hum. Evol. 31:549–561). Further studies on maxillary and dental morphology lead us to attribute A.L. 666-1 to Homo aff. H. habilis. The new Hadar jaw is the first paleontological evidence for the projection of the H. habilis maxillofacial morphotype well back into the Pliocene. It may represent a male of this species, whose maxillary hypodigm consists chiefly of females. A subsidiary finding of our study is that of the three earliest recorded species of Homo (H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, H. erectus), it is H. habilis that exhibits facial morphology closest to that expected in their last common ancestor.

	abstract = {THE Hadar Formation in Ethiopia is a prolific source of Pliocene Hominidae attributed to the species Australopithecus afarensis1. Since 1990, three seasons of field work have contributed 53 new specimens to the hominid inventory from Hadar, including the first fairly complete adult skull. Ranging from 3.0 to 3.4 million years in age (Fig. I) 2–4, the new specimens bear on key debates in hominid palaeontology, including the taxonomic implications of sample variation and the reconstruction of locomotor behaviour. They confirm the taxonomic unity of A. afarensis and constitute the largest body of evidence for about 0.9 million years of stasis in the earliest known hominid species.},

	abstract = {Cranial base morphology differs among hominoids in ways that are usually attributed to some combination of an enlarged brain, retracted face and upright locomotion in humans. The human foramen magnum is anteriorly inclined and, with the occipital condyles, is forwardly located on a broad, short and flexed basicranium; the petrous elements are coronally rotated; the glenoid region is topographically complex; the nuchal lines are low; and the nuchal plane is horizontal. Australopithecus afarensis (3.7–3.0 Ma) is the earliest known species of the australopith grade in which the adult cranial base can be assessed comprehensively. This region of the adult skull was known from fragments in the 1970s, but renewed fieldwork beginning in the 1990s at the Hadar site, Ethiopia (3.4–3.0 Ma), recovered two nearly complete crania and major portions of a third, each associated with a mandible. These new specimens confirm that in small-brained, bipedal Australopithecus the foramen magnum and occipital condyles were anteriorly sited, as in humans, but without the foramen's forward inclination. In the large male A.L. 444-2 this is associated with a short basal axis, a bilateral expansion of the base, and an inferiorly rotated, flexed occipital squama—all derived characters shared by later australopiths and humans. However, in A.L. 822-1 (a female) a more primitive morphology is present: although the foramen and condyles reside anteriorly on a short base, the nuchal lines are very high, the nuchal plane is very steep, and the base is as relatively narrow centrally. A.L. 822-1 illuminates fragmentary specimens in the 1970s Hadar collection that hint at aspects of this primitive suite, suggesting that it is a common pattern in the A. afarensis hypodigm. We explore the implications of these specimens for sexual dimorphism and evolutionary scenarios of functional integration in the hominin cranial base.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Many researchers have obtained extinction-rate estimates for plant populations by comparing historical and current records of occurrence. A population that is no longer found is assumed to have gone extinct. Extinction can then be related to characteristics of these populations, such as habitat type, size, or species, to test ideas about what factors may affect extinction. Such studies neglect the fact that a population may be overlooked, however, which may bias estimates of extinction rates upward. In addition, if populations are unequally detectable across groups to be compared, such as habitat type or population size, comparisons become distorted to an unknown degree. To illustrate the problem, I simulated two data sets, assuming a constant extinction rate, in which populations occurred in different habitats or habitats of different size and these factors affected their detectability. The conventional analysis implicitly assumed that detectability equalled 1 and used logistic regression to estimate extinction rates. It wrongly identified habitat and population size as factors affecting extinction risk. In contrast, with capture-recapture methods, unbiased estimates of extinction rates were recovered. I argue that capture-recapture methods should be considered more often in estimations of demographic parameters in plant populations and communities.},

This canal is absolutely and relatively larger in modern humans than it is in the African apes (Pan and Gorilla). We hypothesize that the human tongue is supplied more richly with motor nerves than are those of living apes and propose that canal size in fossil hominids may provide an indication about the motor coordination of the tongue and reflect the evolution of speech and language. Canals of gracile Australopithecus, and possibly Homo habilis, fall within the range of extant Pan and are significantly smaller than those of modern Homo. The canals of Neanderthals and an early “modern” Homo sapiens (Skhul 5), as well as of African and European middle Pleistocene Homo (Kabwe and Swanscombe), fall within the range of extant Homo and are significantly larger than those of Pan troglodytes. These anatomical findings suggest that the vocal capabilities of Neanderthals were the same as those of humans today. Furthermore, the vocal abilities of Australopithecus were not advanced significantly over those of chimpanzees whereas those of Homo may have been essentially modern by at least 400,000 years ago. Thus, human vocal abilities may have appeared much earlier in time than the first archaeological evidence for symbolic behavior.},

By acknowledging the relative contribution of local and regional dynamics in shaping the complexity of ecological communities, metacommunity theory sheds a new light on the mechanisms underlying the emergence of species. Three integrative frameworks have been proposed, involving neutral dynamics, niche theory, and life history trade-offs respectively. Here, we review these frameworks of metacommunity theory to emphasise that: (1) studies on speciation and community ecology have converged towards similar general principles by acknowledging the central role of dispersal in metacommunities dynamics, (2) considering the conditions of emergence and maintenance of new species in communities has given rise to new models of speciation embedded in the metacommunity theory, (3) studies of diversification have shifted from relating phylogenetic patterns to landscapes spatial and ecological characteristics towards integrative approaches that explicitly consider speciation in a mechanistic ecological framework. We highlight several challenges, in particular the need for a better integration of the eco-evolutionary consequences of dispersal and the need to increase our understanding on the relative rates of evolutionary and ecological changes in communities.},

	abstract = {The Microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important aspect of the health of host species, involved in many biological pathways and processes and potentially useful as health biomarkers. Taking advantage of high-throughput sequencing technologies, modern bacterial microbiome studies are metagenomic, interrogating thousands of taxa simultaneously. Several data analysis frameworks have been proposed for microbiome sequence read count data and for determining the most significant features. However, there is still room for improvement. We introduce a zero-inflated beta-binomial to model the distribution of microbiome count data and to determine association with a continuous or categorical phenotype of interest. The approach can exploit the mean-variance relationship to improve power and adjust for covariates. The proposed method is a mixture model with two components: (i) a zero model accounting for excess zeros and (ii) a count model to capture the remaining component by beta-binomial regression, allowing for overdispersion effects. Simulation studies show that our proposed method effectively controls type I error and has higher power than competing methods to detect taxa associated with phenotype.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Measurement—the assignment of numbers to attributes of the natural world—is central to all scientific inference. Measurement theory concerns the relationship between measurements and reality; its goal is ensuring that inferences about measurements reflect the underlying reality we intend to represent. The key principle of measurement theory is that theoretical context, the rationale for collecting measurements, is essential to defining appropriate measurements and interpreting their values. Theoretical context determines the scale type of measurements and which transformations of those measurements can be made without compromising their meaningfulness. Despite this central role, measurement theory is almost unknown in biology, and its principles are frequently violated. In this review, we present the basic ideas of measurement theory and show how it applies to theoretical as well as empirical work. We then consider examples of empirical and theoretical evolutionary studies whose meaningfulness have been compromised by violations of measurement-theoretic principles. Common errors include not paying attention to theoretical context, inappropriate transformations of data, and inadequate reporting of units, effect sizes, or estimation error. The frequency of such violations reveals the importance of raising awareness of measurement theory among biologists.},

The specificity of these heterophil reactions for I.M. was investigated by determining antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-determined antigens, i.e., to viral capsid antigens (VCA), early antigens (EA), and EBV-associated nuclear antigens (EBNA). On the basis of detectable anti-EA and/or the early absence and late emergence of anti-EBNA, four of these 14 individuals showed evidence of a current or very recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. The other ten patients showed antibody patterns indicative of Epstein-Barr virus infections in the past, and no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the specificity of their heterophil reactions. It was assumed, however, that some represented atypical clinical forms of EBV infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of Downey cells. In three patients, the absorbed heterophil-positive reactions persisted with little change in titer for at least 22 mo and thus might represent false-positive tests.},

	abstract = {The objective of science is to understand the natural world; we argue that prediction is the only way to demonstrate scientific understanding, implying that prediction should be a fundamental aspect of all scientific disciplines. Reproducibility is an essential requirement of good science and arises from the ability to develop models that make accurate predictions on new data. Ecology, however, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction as a central focus and faces its own crisis of reproducibility. Models are where ecological understanding is stored and they are the source of all predictions – no prediction is possible without a model of the world. Models can be improved in three ways: model variables, functional relationships among dependent and independent variables, and in parameter estimates. Ecologists rarely test to assess whether new models have made advances by identifying new and important variables, elucidating functional relationships, or improving parameter estimates. Without these tests it is difficult to know if we understand more today than we did yesterday. A new commitment to prediction in ecology would lead to, among other things, more mature (i.e. quantitative) hypotheses, prioritization of modeling techniques that are more appropriate for prediction (e.g. using continuous independent variables rather than categorical) and, ultimately, advancement towards a more general understanding of the natural world. 
Synthesis
Ecology, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction and therefore the ability to demonstrate understanding. Here we address how this has inhibited progress in ecology and explore how a renewed focus on prediction would benefit ecologists. The lack of emphasis on prediction has resulted in a discipline that tests qualitative, imprecise hypotheses with little concern for whether the results are generalizable beyond where and when the data were collected. A renewed commitment to prediction would allow ecologists to address critical questions about the generalizability of our results and the progress we are making towards understanding the natural world.},

	abstract = {Human evolutionary studies exist in their own right due to our own anthropocentricity, but particularly through developments within the natural sciences. The emergence of an autonomous evolutionary biology has largely engulfed human evolutionary studies. Most perspectives of earlier workers are inexplicit in regard to phylogenetic inference, taxonomic resolution, process, pattern, tempo, and other aspects of hominin evolution, and thus are archaic, irrelevant, or both. Matters of epistemology have scarcely merited explicit, critical consideration; even inference as to the best explanation (abduction) has rarely been employed, or employed consistently. Human populations, their genic structure, variability, affinities and histories are now elucidated and directly quantified through molecular biology and population genetics. Past hominin populations are increasingly composed of samples necessary and sufficient to characterize paleo-demes (p-demes) and, ultimately, species clades representative of spatio-temporally bounded entities, the nature and affinities of which are informed through functional, cladistic, and morphometrical investigation. Diverse aspects of earlier hominin habitats, distributions, adaptations, and behavioral parameters are increasingly revealed through multifaceted approaches, all within the framework of paleoanthropology and focused on fuller recovery and elucidation of the Pleistocene archaeological record. Here, some central aspects of Pleistocene hominin evolution are broadly set out from such perspectives. Controversial issues exist, of course, but overall are secondary, in view of the prevalence of normal scientific practice.},

The focus remains on theory development and the articulation of hypotheses which warrant empirical scrutiny. The chapter uses variants of the Levins metapopulation model to examine some potential consequences for community structure of habitat heterogeneity. The theoretical results suggest that sparse habitats in a heterogeneous landscape are likely to sustain a biased array of species, including habitat specialists with unusually high colonization or low extinction rates, and habitat generalists sustained via spillover from more abundant habitats.},

	abstract = {The most basic adaptation of a species is its ecological niche - that set of environmental conditions, resources, etc. which permit its populations to persist without immigration. Immigration from habitats with conditions within the niche ("source" populations) can sustain populations in habitats outside the niche ("sink" populations). Recent theoretical work on adaptive evolution in source-sink environments suggests that niche evolution should often be conservative, favoring the improvement or maintenance of adaptation to sources, at the expense of improved adaptation in sinks. Niche conservatism requires sinks to remain sinks over evolutionary time-scales. This paper uses models of coupled population and evolutionary dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous environment to examine the effect of density-dependence on niche conservatism and evolution. Density-dependence in birth, death, or dispersal rates can influence the relative evolutionary importance of source and sink habitats. Three distinct dispersal modes are compared. Species with density-dependent, ideal-free dispersal should exhibit niche conservatism. Species with passive or density-independent dispersal are more likely to show niche evolution, but only if rates of dispersal are sufficiently high and fitness in the sink is not too low. Species with active interference leading to a non-ideal free habitat distribution should be expected to be evolutionarily labile in their ecological niches. I conclude that the nature of density-dependence in dispersal may crucially govern the direction of niche evolution.},

	abstract = {The effect of dispersal on population size and stability is explored for a population that disperses passively between two discrete habitat patches. Two basic models are considered. In the first model, a single population experiences density-dependent growth in both patches. A graphical construction is presented which allows one to determine the spatial pattern of abundance at equilibrium for most reasonable growth models and rates of dispersal. It is shown under rather general conditions that this equilibrium is unique and globally stable. In the second model, the dispersing population is a food-limited predator that occurs in both a source habitat (which contains a prey population) and a sink habitat (which does not). Passive dispersal between source and sink habitats can stabilize an otherwise unstable predator-prey interaction. The conditions allowing this are explored in some detail. The theory of optimal habitat selection predicts the evolutionarily stable distribution of a population, given that individuals can freely move among habitats so as to maximize individual fitness. This theory is used to develop a heuristic argument for why passive dispersal should always be selectively disadvantageous (ignoring kin effects) in a spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environment. For both the models considered here, passive dispersal may lead to a greater number of individuals in both habitats combined than if there were no dispersal. This implies that the evolution of an optimal habitat distribution may lead to a reduction in population size; in the case of the predator-prey model, it may have the additional effect of destabilizing the interaction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the disparate effects habitat selection might have on the geographical range occupied by a species.},

Although growth and shrinkage of metacommunities predictably change diversity, separating and merging metacommunities have counterintuitive effects. Separating and merging metacommunities change diversity within the individual areas, especially so for smaller areas, but they cause no change in total diversity of the system, contrary to previous predictions. The response times of metacommunities are likely to be geologically undetectable except for enormously large systems. These models can be used to predict the plate-tectonic effects on the diversity of terrestrial, coastal-marine, deep-marine, and oceanic-island systems. Of these, global and regional coastal-marine systems are the most acutely sensitive to the changes in area and fragmentation caused by plate tectonics. Oceanic-island systems also experience global and regional changes in diversity during supercontinent breakup and assembly, with the global effects driven by the changing length of volcanic arcs, and the regional effects also driven by secondary eustatic changes in shallow-marine area. Although individual terrestrial provinces or continents may experience substantial changes in diversity from rifting and collision, global terrestrial diversity should be unchanged except for the relatively modest contributions caused by the secondary eustatic effects on land area. These changes in diversity may be reinforced or counteracted by the changing latitudinal position of metacommunities.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a review of, and new data concerning, the age of Australopithecus in southern Africa. Current dating suggests that Makapansgat Limeworks is the oldest hominin deposit in southern Africa, with Australopithecus africanus dating to between 3.0 and 2.6 Ma. The Taung Child A. africanus fossil from Taung is most likely penecontemporary with the Makapansgat material between 3.0 and 2.6 Ma. A. africanus from Sterkfontein Member 4 is estimated to date to between 2.6 and 2.0 Ma, with the Sts 5 specimen dating to around 2.0 Ma. The A. africanus deposits from Gladysvale are most likely contemporaneous with the Sterkfontein group with an age between 2.4 and 2.0 Ma. The potential second species of Australopithecus, StW 573 from the Silberberg Grotto at Sterkfontein, is most likely dated to between 2.6 and 2.2 Ma. As such, StW 573 is contemporary with A. africanus fossils from Member 4 and suggest that two contemporary Australopithecus species occurred at Sterkfontein between {\textasciitilde}2.6 and 2.0 Ma. Based on the presence of Equus the A. africanus fossils from Jacovec Cavern also likely date to {\textless}2.4 Ma. The new Australopithecus sediba-bearing deposits of Malapa date to 1.98 Ma and suggests that three different species of Australopithecus occur in South Africa between 2.3 and 1.9 Ma. Given these dates, A. africanus represents the oldest southern African hominin species being found in two temporally distinct groups of sites, Makapansgat/Taung and Sterkfontein/Gladysvale, and A. sediba is the youngest species at {\textasciitilde}1.98 Ma. However, if StW 53 is also Australopithecus, as some have suggested, then this genus survives to younger than 1.8 Ma in South Africa. Australopithecus thus lasted for a significant period of time in southern Africa after the genus is last seen in eastern Africa (Australopithecus garhi at {\textasciitilde}2.5 Ma). This new dating indicates that the South African Australopithecus fossils are younger than previously suggested and are contemporary with the earliest suggested representatives of Homo ({\textasciitilde}2.3 Ma) and Paranthropus (2.7–2.5 Ma) in eastern Africa.},

It has also been conjectured that members of Homo made the first stone tools, currently dated at 2.6–2.4 Myr (refs 6–8). But fossil specimens clearly attributable to Homo before about 1.9 Myr have been lacking. In 1967 a fossil hominoid temporal bone (KNM-BC1) from the Chemeron Formation of Kenya was described as family Hominidae gen. et sp. indet.9. Although a surface find, its provenance within site JM85 (BPRP site K002) was established and a stratigraphic section provided indicating the specimen's position9. This evidence has been affirmed (see for example refs 10–12) but the exact age of the fossil was never determined, and the absence of suitable comparative hominid material has precluded a more definitive taxonomic assignment. Here we present 40Ar/39Ar age determinations on material from the hominid site indicating an age of 2.4 Myr. In addition, comparative studies allow us to assign KNM-BC1 to the genus Homo, making it the earliest securely known fossil of our own genus found so far.},

However, complexity and scale have precluded tests of this prediction in many groups, including fishes. Using a macroevolutionary approach, we test this prediction in butterflyfishes, an iconic group of coral reef inhabitants with diverse social behaviours, foraging strategies and antipredator adaptations. We find that several antipredator traits have evolved adaptively, dependent primarily on foraging strategy. We identify a previously unrecognised axis of diversity in butterflyfishes where species with robust morphological defences have riskier foraging strategies and lack sociality, while species with reduced morphological defences feed in familiar territories, have adaptations for quick escapes and benefit from the vigilance provided by sociality. Furthermore, we find evidence for the constrained evolution of fin spines among species that graze solely on corals, highlighting the importance of corals, as both prey and structural refuge, in shaping fish morphology.},

In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to ?spatial sorting bias?: the difference between the geographic distance from testing?presence to training?presence sites and the geographic distance from testing?absence (or testing?background) to training?presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross?validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45\% and better than Bioclim for 67\% of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver?operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random?absence data instead of independently obtained presence?absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross?validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model.},

	abstract = {Previous observations about the stable nature of coral-rich assemblages from the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group have led some researchers to invoke the primacy of ecological controls in maintaining biofacies structure through time. However, few analyses have examined the degree to which recurring biofacies vary quantitatively, and none have assessed lateral variability as a benchmark for testing the significance of temporal variability. Thus, the extent to which Hamilton biofacies persist and the mechanism(s) responsible for their hypothesized stability remain contentious. In this study, recurring coral-rich biofacies were evaluated from two stratigraphic horizons within the Middle Devonian Appalachian Basin to examine (1) the extent to which species assemblages persisted within the basin through space and time, and (2) whether ecological interactions may be a plausible mechanism for generating the degree of stasis observed in this case. Variations in species composition and abundance were examined across multiple spatial scales within both sampled coral-rich horizons. This permitted the establishment of a baseline against which temporal differences in biofacies composition and structure could be evaluated. Although successive coral-rich horizons remained taxonomically stable, their dominance structures changed significantly through the 1.5 Myr study interval. Moreover, additional comparisons among older Hamilton coral-rich horizons corroborate our primary results. These findings support a model in which species respond individually to fluctuations in the physical environment, as indicated by the fluidity of their relative abundances geographically and temporally.},

              specimens. We describe, date, and contextualize the discovery of two hominin crania from Drimolen Main Quarry in South Africa. At {\textasciitilde}2.04 million to 1.95 million years old, DNH 152 represents the earliest definitive occurrence of
              Paranthropus robustus
              , and DNH 134 represents the earliest occurrence of a cranium with clear affinities to
              Homo erectus
              . These crania also show that
              Homo
              ,
              Paranthropus
              , and
              Australopithecus
              were contemporaneous at {\textasciitilde}2 million years ago. This high taxonomic diversity is also reflected in non-hominin species and provides evidence of endemic evolution and dispersal during a period of climatic variability.},

	abstract = {Fossils of early Homo and Paranthropus have been recovered from several sites in southern Africa. Unfortunately, their precise age has historically been difficult to assess, hampering the reconstruction of their relationships to each other and to fossils from eastern Africa. Multi-dating strategies combining biochronological, archaeological, palaeomagnetic, electron spin resonance (ESR) and uranium series techniques are now clarifying their age. The following sequencing of sites is suggested: Swartkrans Member 1 (∼2.0 Ma), Gondolin (∼1.8 Ma), Kromdraai (1.8–1.7 Ma), Sterkfontein M5A (1.8–1.4 Ma), Swartkrans M2 (1.7–1.1 Ma), Sterkfontein M5B (1.4–1.1 Ma), Sterkfontein M5C (1.3–0.8 Ma), Swartkrans M3 (∼1.0–0.6 Ma). The position of Coopers D and Drimolen is difficult to access because they only have faunal age ranges (1.9–1.6 Ma). ESR suggests mixing is a potential major problem in multi-generational sites. The oldest southern African representatives of early Homo and Paranthropus occur around 2.1–1.9 Ma in Swartkrans Member 1 and are recorded almost continuously in the palaeocave deposits until around 1.0–0.6 Ma in Swartkrans Member 3. Currently, these data suggest that Paranthropus and Homo first occur significantly later in the southern African record than the eastern African record. Moreover, Paranthropus persists much later in southern Africa than in eastern Africa.},

These facts led to the widespread notion that the human brain is literally extraordinary: an outlier among mammalian brains, defying evolutionary rules that apply to other species, with a uniqueness seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over mammals with even larger brains. These facts, with deep implications for neurophysiology and evolutionary biology, are not grounded on solid evidence or sound assumptions, however. Our recent development of a method that allows rapid and reliable quantification of the numbers of cells that compose the whole brain has provided a means to verify these facts. Here, I review this recent evidence and argue that, with 86 billion neurons and just as many nonneuronal cells, the human brain is a scaled-up primate brain in its cellular composition and metabolic cost, with a relatively enlarged cerebral cortex that does not have a relatively larger number of brain neurons yet is remarkable in its cognitive abilities and metabolism simply because of its extremely large number of neurons.},

It has been apparent since the time of ecological pioneers such as Bates and Darwin that tropical systems have disproportionately large numbers of rare species, yet the distribution and abundance patterns of these species remain largely unknown. Here, we examine the diversity of freshwater fish in a series of lakes in the Amazonian várzea, and relate relative abundance, both as numbers of individuals and as biomass, to the occurrence of species in space and time. We find a bimodal relationship of occurrence that distinguishes temporally and spatially persistent species from those that are infrequent in both space and time. Logistic regression reveals that information on occurrence helps distinguish those species that are rare in this locality but abundant elsewhere, from those that are rare throughout the region. These results form a link between different approaches used to evaluate commonness and rarity. In doing so, they provide a tool for identifying species of high conservation priority in poorly documented but species rich localities.},

A considerable amount of ambiguity and inconsistency persists within the field, and we provide a number of suggestions that should improve study design, inference, and clarity of presentation. (1) Some studies measure change over time within a population (allochronic) and others measure the difference between two populations that had a common ancestor in the past (synchronic). Allochronic studies can be used to estimate rates of "evolution," whereas synchronic studies more appropriately estimate rates of "divergence." Rates of divergence may range from a small fraction to many times the actual evolutionary rates in the component populations. (2) Some studies measure change using individuals captured from the wild, whereas others measure differences after rearing in a common environment. The first type of study can be used to specify "phenotypic" rates and the later "genetic" rates. (3) The most commonly used evolutionary rate metric, the darwin, has a number of theoretical shortcomings. Studies of microevolution would benefit from specifying rates in standard deviations per generation, the haldane. (4) Evolutionary rates are typically specified without an indication of their precision. Readily available methods for specifying confidence intervals and statistical significance (regression, bootstrapping, randomization) should be implemented. (5) Microevolutionists should strive to accumulate time series, which can reveal temporal shifts in the rate of evolution and can be used to identify evolutionary patterns. (6) Evolutionary rates provide a convenient way to compare the tempo of evolution across studies, traits, taxa, and time scales, but such comparisons are subject to varying degrees of confidence. Comparisons across different time scales are particularly tenuous. (7) A number of multivariate rate measures exist, but considerable theoretical development is required before their utility can be determined. We encourage the continued investigation of evolutionary rates because the information they provide is relevant to a wide range of theoretical and practical issues.},

	abstract = {The fundamental equation in evolutionary quantitative genetics, the Lande equation, describes the response to directional selection as a product of the additive genetic variance and the selection gradient of trait value on relative fitness. Comparisons of both genetic variances and selection gradients across traits or populations require standardization, as both are scale dependent. The Lande equation can be standardized in two ways. Standardizing by the variance of the selected trait yields the response in units of standard deviation as the product of the heritability and the variance-standardized selection gradient. This standardization conflates selection and variation because the phenotypic variance is a function of the genetic variance. Alternatively, one can standardize the Lande equation using the trait mean, yielding the proportional response to selection as the product of the squared coefficient of additive genetic variance and the mean-standardized selection gradient. Mean-standardized selection gradients are particularly useful for summarizing the strength of selection because the mean-standardized gradient for fitness itself is one, a convenient benchmark for strong selection. We review published estimates of directional selection in natural populations using mean-standardized selection gradients. Only 38 published studies provided all the necessary information for calculation of mean-standardized gradients. The median absolute value of multivariate mean-standardized gradients shows that selection is on average 54\% as strong as selection on fitness. Correcting for the upward bias introduced by taking absolute values lowers the median to 31\%, still very strong selection. Such large estimates clearly cannot be representative of selection on all traits. Some possible sources of overestimation of the strength of selection include confounding environmental and genotypic effects on fitness, the use of fitness components as proxies for fitness, and biases in publication or choice of traits to study.},

This forest is characterized by a high diversity and very high number of rare species. Out of the 745 species occurring with {\textgreater} five individuals, 80.4 \% had an aggregated distribution, 19.5\% were randomly distributed and one species had a regular distribution. The spatial patterns of rare vs. common species, juvenile vs. adult trees, and coarse vs. fine scales were compared. Rare species are generally less aggregated than common ones and most of the randomly distributed species are rare. Spatial patterns shift from high clumping to looser intensity or random distribution when moving from juveniles to adults for the same species. No adult tree species display a regular pattern, however. Regular distributions were rarely found; this is probably due to intraspecific competition at a local scale. There is a negative correlation between per capita death rate and population density. This study suggests that the Pasoh forest and its high diversity are subjected to multiple controlling factors, e.g., topography, spacing effect, density-dependent processes and species rarity. The importance of any factor changes across spatial and temporal scales.},

Given a sufficiently deep, robust, well-resolved, and stratigraphically consistent cladogram, this method can yield useful age constraints even in the absence of specific information about the fossil preservation and recovery rates of individual taxa. The algorithm is applied to simulated data sets to demonstrate that this method can yield robust constraints of clade ages if there are sufficient fossil outgroups available and if there is a finite chance that additional outgroups may be discovered in the future. Finally, the technique is applied to actual fossil data to explore the origin of modern placental mammals. Using data from recently published cladograms, this method indicates that if all Mesozoic eutherians are regarded as outgroups of Placentalia, then the last common ancestor of modern placental mammals and their Cenozoic allies lived between 65 and 88–98 million years ago, depending on the assumed cladogram and the number of outgroups included in the analysis.},

This activity helps students explore foundational concepts in biology, enables them to collect data in a simplistic field setting, and introduces them to statistical analyses and modeling.

	abstract = {The interspecific relationship between local abundance and regional distribution, as well as the occupancy frequency distribution, are widely studied topics in macroecology. A positive abundance–occupancy relationship has been found in a majority of studies, and satellite species modes are typically dominant in occupancy frequency distributions. However, there are a number of exceptions to these “general” findings, and only a few studies have examined these patterns and their temporal variability in stream organisms. I examined both abundance–occupancy relationships and occupancy frequency distributions in stream insects in a boreal drainage system over six consecutive years. I found that the positive interspecific abundance–occupancy relationship was highly stable temporally, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.25 to 0.47 over the years. There were no strong differences in the strength and slope of the abundance–occupancy relationship between non-predatory and predatory insect species in each year. Temporally stable abundance–occupancy relationships were paralleled by among-year patterns in both abundance and occupancy, with locally abundant and widely distributed species remaining locally abundant and widely distributed over the years, while locally uncommon and regionally rare species showed the opposite. Occupancy frequency distributions were strongly right-skewed, mirroring the dominance of the left-most satellite mode of regionally rare species. That the abundance–occupancy relationship, species’ abundances and distributions, as well as the dominance of satellite species in occupancy frequency distribution were temporally stable suggest that niche-based models are strong candidates for explaining these patterns in stream insects. By contrast, metapopulation-based models that predict clear temporal variability in species’ abundance and occupancy, as well as bimodal occupancy frequency distributions, are less plausible candidates for explaining the observed patterns. The present findings are the opposite to those in some terrestrial studies, but they are in agreement with other terrestrial studies and with a few previous studies on stream organisms.},

	abstract = {Although area, species abundances, spatial distribution, and species richness have been central components of community ecology, their interrelationships are not completely understood. To describe these interrelationships, we study and test three patterns regarding species richness using species–area models. The first one is the widely accepted generalization that states that the number of species monotonically increases with sampling area. The second pattern predicts the decrease in species richness with the increase of species dominance in a given area. The third one predicts that spatial aggregation of individuals within species results in lower species richness in communities. These three generalizations were investigated by modeling and simulations. First, a random-placement species–area model was used to evaluate the effects of relative species abundances on species richness in a sampling area. Then, a nonrandom species–area model was derived which explicitly encompasses the spatial distributions of species; it served to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in spatial distributions on species richness. Species–area models were numerically evaluated using parameters estimated from a tropical rain forest community, and simulations were conducted to support the numerical solutions. The three patterns regarding species diversity were consistently supported by the results. A discussion ensues, describing how the three patterns can be used to interpret and predict species diversity, and how they are supported by other diversity hypotheses. The three generalizations suggest that, if we want to understand species diversity, we should go and look for mechanisms that influence the abundances and spatial distributions of species. If a mechanism can make the species abundances more even, or their spatial distributions more regular, this factor likely contributes to species coexistence.},

	abstract = {Extinction from habitat loss is the signature conservation problem of the twenty-first century. Despite its importance, estimating extinction rates is still highly uncertain because no proven direct methods or reliable data exist for verifying extinctions. The most widely used indirect method is to estimate extinction rates by reversing the species-area accumulation curve, extrapolating backwards to smaller areas to calculate expected species loss. Estimates of extinction rates based on this method are almost always much higher than those actually observed. This discrepancy gave rise to the concept of an /`extinction debt/', referring to species /`committed to extinction/' owing to habitat loss and reduced population size but not yet extinct during a non-equilibrium period. Here we show that the extinction debt as currently defined is largely a sampling artefact due to an unrecognized difference between the underlying sampling problems when constructing a species-area relationship (SAR) and when extrapolating species extinction from habitat loss. The key mathematical result is that the area required to remove the last individual of a species (extinction) is larger, almost always much larger, than the sample area needed to encounter the first individual of a species, irrespective of species distribution and spatial scale. We illustrate these results with data from a global network of large, mapped forest plots and ranges of passerine bird species in the continental USA; and we show that overestimation can be greater than 160\%. Although we conclude that extinctions caused by habitat loss require greater loss of habitat than previously thought, our results must not lead to complacency about extinction due to habitat loss, which is a real and growing threat.},

This study used reviews of the prey preferences of African wild dog Lycaon pictus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, leopard Panthera pardus, lion P. leo, and spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta to investigate the degree of dietary overlap and dietary niche breadth amongst the guild. Wild dogs and cheetahs exhibited the greatest dietary overlap and smallest dietary niche breadth, while lions exhibited the least dietary overlap and, with leopards, had the broadest dietary niche breadth. Increased extinction risk within the guild was related to lower dietary niche breadth. The behavioural and morphological specializations of the two most threatened predators (wild dogs and cheetahs) limit the prey available to them, and increases the potential for dietary competition. Conversely, the large body mass and group hunting strategy of lions and the predatory flexibility of leopards and spotted hyaenas minimizes the effects of dietary overlap, assuring a more secure status. This study intimates reasons why cheetahs and African wild dogs are naturally less common than lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas in unmodified landscapes. The methods used can be applied to all adequately studied faunal guilds and could highlight previously undetected competitors.},

Knowledge of which species are actually preferred and which are avoided is lacking, however, as is an understanding of why such preference or avoidance may arise. An analysis of 32 studies over 48 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the lion shows that it preferentially preys upon species within a weight range of 190–550 kg. The most preferred weight of lion prey is 350 kg. The mean mass of significantly preferred prey species is 290 kg and of all preferred species is 201 kg. Gemsbok, buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe and zebra are significantly preferred. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided. Species within the preferred weight range that are not significantly preferred (such as roan, sable and eland) generally have features that reduce predation either morphologically (e.g. sable horns), ecologically (e.g. roan and sable occurring at low density), or behaviourally (e.g. the large herd size and increased vigilance of eland). Warthog are below the preferred weight range yet are taken in accordance with their availability and this is probably due to their sympatry with lion, their relatively slow evasion speed and their lower level of vigilance. Plots of prey preference against prey body mass follows a bell curve with a right skew that, we argue, is caused by collective hunting by lions of larger-bodied prey. Our methods can be used on all large predators and are likely to be useful in assessing competition in sympatric communities of predators, cooperative hunting and predicting predator diets. This will allow us to move beyond descriptive dietary studies to improve our predictive understanding of the mechanisms underlying predator–prey interactions.},

Cheetah are generally considered to capture medium-sized prey; however, which species are actually preferred and why has yet to be addressed. We used data from 21 published and two unpublished studies from six countries throughout the distribution of the cheetah to determine which prey species were preferred and which were avoided using Jacobs' index. The mean Jacobs' index value for each prey species was used as the dependent variable in multiple regression, with prey abundance and prey body mass as predictive variables. Cheetah prefer to kill and actually kill the most available prey present at a site within a body mass range of 23–56 kg with a peak (mode) at 36 kg. Blesbok, impala, Thomson's and Grant's gazelles, and springbok are significantly preferred, whereas prey outside this range are generally avoided. The morphological adaptations of the cheetah appear to have evolved to capture medium-sized prey that can be subdued with minimal risk of injury. Coincidentally, these species can be consumed rapidly before kleptoparasites arrive. These results are discussed through the premise of optimality theory whereby decisions made by the predator maximize the net energetic benefits of foraging. Information is also presented that allows conservation managers to determine which prey species should be in adequate numbers at cheetah reintroduction sites to support a cheetah population. Conversely, these results will illustrate which potential prey species of local conservation concern should be monitored for impact from cheetahs as several species are likely to be preyed upon more frequently than others.},

Ecological systems can switch between alternative dynamic states. For example, the species composition of the community can change or nutrient dynamics can shift, even if there is little or no change in underlying environmental conditions. Such switches can be abrupt or more gradual, and a growing number of studies examine the transient dynamics between one state and another—particularly in the context of anthropogenic global change. Hastings et al. review current knowledge of transient dynamics, showing that hitherto idiosyncratic and individual patterns can be classified into a coherent framework, with important general lessons and directions for future study.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDMuch of ecological theory and the understanding of ecological systems has been based on the idea that the observed states and dynamics of ecological systems can be represented by stable asymptotic behavior of models describing these systems. Beginning with early work by Lotka and Volterra through the seminal work of May in the 1970s, this view has dominated much of ecological thinking, although concepts such as the idea of tipping points in ecological systems have played an increasingly important role. In contrast to the implied long time scales of asymptotic behavior in mathematical models, both observations of ecological systems and questions related to the management of ecological systems are typically focused on relatively short time scales.A number of models and observations demonstrate possible transient behavior that may persist over very long time periods, followed by rapid changes in dynamics. In these examples, focusing solely on the long-term behavior of systems would be misleading. A long transient is a persistent dynamical regime—including near-constant dynamics, cyclic dynamics, or even apparently chaotic dynamics—that persists for more than a few and as many as tens of generations, but which is not the stable long-term dynamic that would eventually occur. These examples have demonstrated the potential importance of transients but have often appeared to be a set of idiosyncratic cases. What is needed is an organized approach that describes when a transient behavior is likely to appear, predicts what factors enhance long transients, and describes the characteristics of this transient behavior. A theory of long ecological transients is a counterpart to the related question of tipping points, where previous work based on an analysis of simple bifurcations has provided broad insights.
ADVANCESJust as ideas based on the saddle-node bifurcation provide a basis for understanding tipping points, a suite of ideas from dynamical systems provides a way to organize a systematic study of transient dynamics in ecological systems. As illustrated in the figure, a relatively small number of ideas from dynamical systems are used to categorize the different ways that transients can arise. Translating these abstract results from dynamical systems into observations about both ecological models and ecological system dynamics, it is possible to understand when transients are likely to occur and the various properties of these transients, with implications for ecosystem management and basic ecological theory. Transients can provide an explanation for observed regime shifts that does not depend on underlying environmental changes. Systems that continually change rapidly between different long-lasting dynamics, such as insect outbreaks, may most usefully be viewed using the framework of long transients.An initial focus on conceptual systems, such as two-species systems, establishes the ubiquity of transients and an understanding of what ecological aspects can lead to transients, including the presence of multiple time scales and particular nonlinear interactions. The influences of stochasticity and more realistic higher-dimensional dynamics are shown to increase the likelihood, and possibly the temporal extent, of transient dynamics.
OUTLOOKThe development of such a framework for organizing the study of transients in ecological systems opens up a number of avenues for future research and application. The approach we describe also raises important questions for further development in dynamical systems. We have not, for example, emphasized nonautonomous systems, which may be required to understand the implications of a changing environment for transients. Systems with explicit time dependence as well as stochastic nonlinear systems still present great mathematical challenges.Implications for management and basic ecological understanding depend on both the results we describe and future developments. A recognition of the difficulty of prediction caused by long transients, and of the corresponding need to match dynamics to transient behaviors of models, shows that basing either management or interpretation of ecological observations only on long-term dynamics can be seriously flawed. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6406/eaat6412/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Two ways that long transients arise in ecology, illustrated as a ball rolling downhill.(A) Slow transition away from a ghost attractor: a state that is not an equilibrium, but would be under slightly different conditions. (B) Lingering near a saddle: a state that is attracting from some directions but repelling from others. Additional factors such as stochasticity, multiple time scales, and high system dimension can extend transients.
The importance of transient dynamics in ecological systems and in the models that describe them has become increasingly recognized. However, previous work has typically treated each instance of these dynamics separately. We review both empirical examples and model systems, and outline a classification of transient dynamics based on ideas and concepts from dynamical systems theory. This classification provides ways to understand the likelihood of transients for particular systems, and to guide investigations to determine the timing of sudden switches in dynamics and other characteristics of transients. Implications for both management and underlying ecological theories emerge.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We tested the proposition that there are more species in the tropics because basal clades adapted to warm paleoclimates have been lost in regions now experiencing cool climates. Molecular phylogenies were used to classify species as “basal” and “derived” based on their family, and their richness patterns were contrasted. Path models also evaluated environmental predictors of richness patterns. As predicted, basal clades are more diverse in the lowland tropics, whereas derived clades are more diverse in the extratropics and high‐altitude tropics. Seventy‐four percent of the variation in bird richness was explained by environmental variables, but models differed for basal and derived groups. The overall gradient is described by the spatial pattern of basal clades, although there are differences in the Old and New Worlds. We conclude that in ecological time, the global richness gradient reflects birds’ responses to climatic gradients, partially operating via plants. Over evolutionary time, the gradient primarily reflects the extirpation of species in older clades from parts of the world that have become cooler in the present. A strong secondary effect arises from dispersal of clades from centers of origin and subsequent radiations. Overall, the diversity gradient is well explained by niche conservatism and the “time‐for‐speciation” hypothesis.},

	abstract = {There have been numerous claims in the ecological literature that spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models results in shifts in the partial coefficients, which bias the interpretation of factors influencing geographical patterns. We evaluate the validity of these claims using gridded species richness data for the birds of North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the ex-USSR, and Australia. We used richness in 110×110 km cells and environmental predictor variables to generate OLS and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) multiple regression models for each region. Spatial correlograms of the residuals from each OLS model were then used to identify the minimum distance between cells necessary to avoid short-distance residual spatial autocorrelation in each data set. This distance was used to subsample cells to generate spatially independent data. The partial OLS coefficients estimated with the full dataset were then compared to the distributions of coefficients created with the subsamples. We found that OLS coefficients generated from data containing residual spatial autocorrelation were statistically indistinguishable from coefficients generated from the same data sets in which short-distance spatial autocorrelation was not present in all 22 coefficients tested. Consistent with the statistical literature on this subject, we conclude that coefficients estimated from OLS regression are not seriously affected by the presence of spatial autocorrelation in gridded geographical data. Further, shifts in coefficients that occurred when using SAR tended to be correlated with levels of uncertainty in the OLS coefficients. Thus, shifts in the relative importance of the predictors between OLS and SAR models are expected when small-scale patterns for these predictors create weaker and more unstable broad-scale coefficients. Our results indicate both that OLS regression is unbiased and that differences between spatial and nonspatial regression models should be interpreted with an explicit awareness of spatial scale.},

The analysis shows that mean alpha-diversity remained surprisingly constant through most of the Jurassic, whereas beta-diversity increased by a factor of 2.6 during the same time interval. Diversification that is primarily driven by increasing beta-diversity is indicative of late diversification phases in ecosystems with low interspecific competition and/or high predation, as typical for marine level-bottom communities. Although generality of this conclusion is not claimed because of data limitations, the example demonstrates that the study of diversity partitioning provides a promising approach to the basic question about the factors that control the diversification of life.},

	abstract = {The latitudinal diversity gradient is the largest scale, and longest known, pattern in ecology. We examined the applicability of three versions of the energy hypothesis, the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, and historical contingency to the gradient of terrestrial birds. The productivity version of the energy hypothesis, tested using actual evapotranspiration, a water-energy variable closely associated with plant productivity, accounted for 72\% of the variance in a model of global extent. An historical contingency model based on biogeographic region explained 58\% of the variance. A combined climate-region model accounted for 78\% of the variance, but 52\% comprised the overlap between these effects. This suggests that further resolution of contemporary vs. historical processes at the global level will require the inclusion of phylogenetic information. Regional-extent regression models suggest a latitudinal shift in constraints on diversity; measures of ambient energy (potential evapotranspiration and mean annual temperature) best predicted the diversity gradient at high latitudes, whereas water-related variables (actual evapotranspiration and annual rainfall) best predicted richness in low-latitude, high-energy regions. Intraregional spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed that climatic models adequately describe geographic richness patterns at all but the smallest spatial scales resolved by the analysis. We conclude that the "water-energy dynamics" hypothesis, originally developed for plant diversity gradients, offers a parsimonious explanation for bird diversity patterns as well, presumably operating via plant productivity. However, more refined tests of historical factors are needed to fully resolve their influences on the gradient.},

	abstract = {A theory of spatial structure in ecological communities is presented and tested. At the core of the theory is a simple allocation rule for the assembly of species in space. The theory leads, with no adjustable parameters, to nonrandom statistical predictions for the spatial distribution of species at multiple spatial scales. The distributions are such that the abundance of a species at the largest measured scale uniquely determines the spatial-abundance distribution of the individuals of that species at smaller spatial scales. The shape of the species–area relationship, the endemics–area relationship, a scale-dependent community-level spatial-abundance distribution, the species-abundance distribution at small spatial scales, an index of intraspecific aggregation, the range–area relationship, and the dependence of species turnover on interpatch distance and on patch size are also uniquely predicted as a function solely of the list of abundances of the species at the largest spatial scale. We show that the spatial structure of three spatially explicit vegetation census data sets (i.e., a 64-m2 serpentine grassland plot, a 50-ha moist tropical forest plot, and a 9.68-ha dry tropical forest plot) are generally consistent with the predictions of the theory, despite the very simple statistical assumption upon which the theory is based, and the absence of adjustable parameters. However, deviations between predicted and observed distributions do arise for the species with the highest abundances; the pattern of those deviations indicates that the theory, which currently contains no explicit description of interaction mechanisms among individuals within species, could be improved with the incorporation of intraspecific density dependence.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather events, such as drought, have marked impacts on biotic communities. In many regions, a predicted increase in occurrence of such events will be imposed on landscapes already heavily modified by human land-use. There is an urgency, therefore, to understand the way in which the effects of such events may be exacerbated, or moderated, by different patterns of landscape change. We used empirical data on woodland-dependent birds in south-east Australia, collected during and after a severe drought, to document temporal change in the composition of bird assemblages in 24 landscapes (each 100 km2) representing a gradient in the cover of native wooded vegetation (from 60\% to {\textless}2\%). We examined a) whether drought caused region-wide homogenization of the composition of landscape bird assemblages, and b) whether landscape properties influenced the way assemblages changed in response to drought. To quantify change, we used pairwise indices of assemblage dissimilarity, partitioned into components that represented change in the richness of assemblages and change in the identity of constituent species (turnover). There was widespread loss of woodland birds in response to drought, with only partial recovery following drought-breaking rains. Region-wide, the composition of landscape assemblages became more different over time, primarily caused by turnover-related differentiation. The response of bird assemblages to drought varied between landscapes and was strongly associated with landscape properties. The extent of wooded vegetation had the greatest influence on assemblage change: landscapes with more native vegetation had more stable bird assemblages over time. However, for the component processes of richness- and turnover-related compositional change, measures of landscape productivity had a stronger effect. For example, landscapes with more riparian vegetation maintained more stable assemblages in terms of richness. These results emphasize the importance of the total extent of native vegetation - both overall cover and that occurring in productive parts of the landscape - for maintaining bird communities whose composition is resistant to severe drought. While extreme climatic events cannot be prevented, their effects can be ameliorated by managing the pattern of native vegetation in anthropogenic landscapes, with associated benefits for maintaining ecological processes and human wellbeing.},

Nevertheless, it should be noted that there are several constraining factors that limit the degree of precision of such correlations, as follows: (1) There are few late Miocene and early Pliocene sites that have been dated radiometrically, and these are restricted geographically to the East African Rift valley (i.e., the Turkana basin, the Baringo basin, the Samburu Hills, and the Middle Awash Valley); (2) with the exception of Lotha-gam in northern Kenya and Langebaanweg in South Africa, the mammalian faunas from this time period are either poorly known or have not been the subject of detailed study; and (3) few researchers have made detailed firsthand comparisons between late Miocene and early Pliocene faunas from fossil localities in North, East, and South Africa.},

	abstract = {Renewed investigations at Laetoli in northern Tanzania have led to the recovery of a number of new fossil hominins. A lower canine and a mandibular fragment from the Upper Laetolil Beds (3.63–3.85 Ma) are referred to Australopithecus afarensis, and an edentulous maxilla and a proximal tibia from the Upper Ndolanya Beds (2.66 Ma) are attributed to Paranthropus aethiopicus and Hominini gen. et sp. indet., respectively. Additional hominin specimens from earlier collections are described here for the first time, including three specimens of A. afarensis, probably from the Upper Laetolil Beds, and a possible cranial fragment of an infant from the Upper Ndolanya Beds. The chronology and provenance of the Laetoli hominins are reconsidered. The species afarensis is provisionally retained in Australopithecus to reflect its anatomical and paleobiological similarities to the other species of Australopithecus sensu lato, but a reasonable case could be made on phylogenetic grounds to transfer it to Praeanthropus. It has been argued that the Laetoli sample of A. afarensis is morphologically and temporally intermediate between A. anamensis and the Hadar sample of A. afarensis, and that A. anamensis and A. afarensis represent a single anagenetically evolving lineage. However, the new specimens from the Upper Laetolil Beds help to close the gap between the Laetoli and Hadar samples, and a critical assessment of the morphological variation in the two samples indicates that there are few consistent differences separating them. Rather than being intermediate in morphology, the Laetoli sample appears to represents an earlier population of A. afarensis, with almost the full complement of derived features that characterizes the Hadar sample, but still retaining a few primitive traits. The morphological features that distinguish A. anamensis from A. afarensis are much more extensive, and these provide adequate justification for the recognition of a species distinction. The evidence best fits an evolutionary model involving a cladogenetic event rather than a simple anagenetic transformation of a single unbranched anamensis-afarensis lineage through time. The Paranthopus aethiopicus specimen from the Upper Ndolanya Beds represents the ­oldest securely dated specimen definitively attributable to this taxon and the first definitive record outside of the Turkana Basin. The Paranthropus clade probably immigrated into eastern Africa before 2.7 Ma, and became widely distributed throughout the region soon thereafter. The timing and biogeographic patterning of the occurrence of Paranthropus and Homo suggest that their respective dispersals into eastern Africa were not coincident or synchronous. Homo appeared somewhat later than Paranthropus across most of eastern Africa, except in the Awash region of Ethiopia where Homo makes its first appearance in the absence of Paranthropus. These differences in the timing and distribution suggest that Paranthropus and Homo may have had different biogeographic histories, and that their ancestral species may have had different ecological requirements at the time of their initial influx into eastern Africa.},

	abstract = {Local ecological communities represent the scale at which species coexist and share resources, and at which diversity has been experimentally shown to underlie stability, productivity, invasion resistance, and other desirable community properties. Globally, community diversity shows a mixture of increases and decreases over recent decades, and these changes have relatively seldom been linked to climatic trends. In a heterogeneous California grassland, we documented declining plant diversity from 2000 to 2014 at both the local community (5 m2) and landscape (27 km2) scales, across multiple functional groups and soil environments. Communities became particularly poorer in native annual forbs, which are present as small seedlings in midwinter; within native annual forbs, community composition changed toward lower representation of species with a trait indicating drought intolerance (high specific leaf area). Time series models linked diversity decline to the significant decrease in midwinter precipitation. Livestock grazing history, fire, succession, N deposition, and increases in exotic species could be ruled out as contributing causes. This finding is among the first demonstrations to our knowledge of climate-driven directional loss of species diversity in ecological communities in a natural (nonexperimental) setting. Such diversity losses, which may also foreshadow larger-scale extinctions, may be especially likely in semiarid regions that are undergoing climatic trends toward higher aridity and lower productivity.},

	abstract = {Energy and nutrients are the fundamental currencies of ecology and changes in energy and nutrient availability are thought to have played an important role in the long-term development of marine ecosystems. However, meaningfully quantifying when, where, and how such changes have occurred has been a difficult and longstanding problem. Here, some of the various lines of evidence that have been brought to bear on this issue in the past two decades are reviewed, particularly those based on the fossil record of benthic invertebrates. This paper focuses on abundance, body size, and metabolism, three distinct but closely interrelated aspects of ecosystem structure that control (or are controlled by) energy fluxes. Each of these is subject to biases and inherent uncertainties that present significant challenges for making inferences from the fossil record, but when carefully controlling for environmental, taphonomic, and methodological variations there are robust trends that can be discerned above the noise. Integrating these different types of data in a single quantitative framework presents additional complications, but coherent patterns emerge from some such analyses. Accurate quantification of energetic trends in the fossil record is difficult but is a worthwhile goal because of its potential to illuminate the energetic dimension of major diversifications, extinctions, and secular ecological-evolutionary trends and link them more directly to their Earth Systems context.},

	abstract = {Regional conservation planning can often make more effective use of sparse biological data by linking these data to remotely mapped environmental variables through statistical modelling. While modelling distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia, and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness of community-level modelling by: (1) more closely integrating modelling with traditional ecological mapping (e.g. vegetation mapping); (2) more tightly linking numerical classification and spatial modelling through application of canonical classification techniques; and (3) enhancing the applicability of modelling to data-poor regions through employment of a new technique for modelling spatial pattern in compositional dissimilarity.},

Application of such modelling to planning in the northeast New South Wales (NSW) region of Australia represents one of the most extensive and longest running case studies of this approach anywhere in the world. Since the early 1980s, statistical modelling has been used to extrapolate distributions of over 2300 species of plants and animals, and a wide variety of higher-level communities and assemblages. These modelled distributions have played a pivotal role in a series of major land-use planning processes, culminating in extensive additions to the region's protected area system. This paper provides an overview of the analytical methodology used to model distributions of individual species in northeast NSW, including approaches to: (1) developing a basic integrated statistical and geographical information system (GIS) framework to facilitate automated fitting and extrapolation of species models; (2) extending this basic approach to incorporate consideration of spatial autocorrelation, land-cover mapping and expert knowledge; and (3) evaluating the performance of species modelling, both in terms of predictive accuracy and in terms of the effectiveness with which such models function as general surrogates for biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The greater area of tropical forest biomes has been proposed as a factor that drives the latitudinal gradient in species diversity by modulating speciation and extinction rates. But speciation and extinction are processes that operate over millions of years, so an adequate test of area’s contribution to diversity patterns must take into consideration that biome areas have changed through time in response to climate. Here we correlate estimates of current tree species diversity with a composite parameter integrating area over geological time for each continent’s tropical, temperate, and boreal biomes. We find significant positive correlations between current tree diversity and area‐time for periods since the Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene, which we take as evidence for a time‐integrated species‐area effect on current patterns of species richness across biomes. These results contribute to explanations for why most lineages have tropical origins and why tropical forests are more diverse than extratropical forests.},

	abstract = {Species interactions can play a major role in shaping evolution in new environments. In theory, species interactions can either stimulate evolution by promoting coevolution or inhibit evolution by constraining ecological opportunity. The relative strength of these effects should vary as species richness increases, and yet there has been little evidence for evolution of component species in communities. We evolved bacterial microcosms containing between 1 and 12 species in three different environments. Growth rates and yields of isolates that evolved in communities were lower than those that evolved in monocultures, consistent with recent theory that competition constrains species to specialize on narrower sets of resources. This effect saturated or reversed at higher levels of richness, consistent with theory that directional effects of species interactions should weaken in more diverse communities. Species varied considerably, however, in their responses to both environment and richness levels. Mechanistic models and experiments are now needed to understand and predict joint evolutionary dynamics of species in diverse communities.},

	abstract = {Storm-generated event beds are an important source of paleoecological information, especially in Paleozoic strata. Storm deposition and subsequent physical and biological modification can potentially alter the diversity structure of death assemblages significantly. To examine the effects of storm deposition on fossil assemblage composition, storm beds are compared with co-occurring beds representing background sedimentation in 67 samples from six Ordovician mixed carbonate-clastic units deposited above the maximum storm wave base. In the great majority of pairwise comparisons, evenness and sampled richness are higher in storm beds than in background beds. This effect is not explained by differences in lithification, skeletal fragmentation, or in the proportions of aragonitic or multielement skeletons. The elevated diversity of storm beds can result from homogenization of fine-scale faunal patchiness preserved in background beds or may be due to taphonomic feedback. The relative importance of these two end-member scenarios can be evaluated with detrended correspondence analysis. In shallow, carbonate-dominated environments, the former appears to predominate, while the latter is more important in a deeper setting dominated by fine-grained clastics. The disparity between background beds and storm beds suggests that, at least in the Lower Paleozoic, background beds may record a higher-resolution paleoecological signal while storm beds record a more complete census of alpha diversity. Because post–Middle Ordovician increases in the depth and intensity of bioturbation may have diminished the temporal resolution and increase the faunal completeness of background beds, this disparity is not necessarily expected in younger strata.},

Dmanisi's rich collection of hominin fossils, revealing a population that was small-brained with both primitive and derived skeletal traits, has been dated to the earliest Upper Matuyama chron (ca. 1.77 Ma). Here we present archaeological and geologic evidence that push back Dmanisi's first occupations to shortly after 1.85 Ma and document repeated use of the site over the last half of the Olduvai subchron, 1.85–1.78 Ma. These discoveries show that the southern Caucasus was occupied repeatedly before Dmanisi's hominin fossil assemblage accumulated, strengthening the probability that this was part of a core area for the colonization of Eurasia. The secure age for Dmanisi's first occupations reveals that Eurasia was probably occupied before Homo erectus appears in the East African fossil record.},

	abstract = {Comprehension of changes in community composition through multiple spatio-temporal scales is a prime challenge in ecology and palaeobiology. However, assembly, structuring and disassembly of biotic metacommunities in deep-time is insufficiently known. To address this, we used the extensively sampled Iberian Plio-Pleistocene fossil record of rodent faunas as our model system to explore how global climatic events may alter metacommunity structure. Through factor analysis, we found five sets of genera, called faunal components, which co-vary in proportional diversity over time. These faunal components had different spatio-temporal distributions throughout the Plio-Pleistocene, resulting in non-random changes in species assemblages, particularly in response to the development of the Pleistocene glaciations. Three successive metacommunities with distinctive taxonomic structures were identified as a consequence of the differential responses of their members to global climatic change: (1) Ruscinian subtropical faunas (5.3–3.4 Ma) dominated by a faunal component that can be considered as a Miocene legacy; (2) transition faunas during the Villafranchian–Biharian (3.4–0.8 Ma) with a mixture of different faunal components; and (3) final dominance of the temperate Toringian faunas (0.8–0.01 Ma) that would lead to the modern Iberian assemblage. The influence of the cooling global temperature drove the reorganisation of these rodent metacommunities. Selective extinction processes due to this large-scale environmental disturbance progressively eliminated the subtropical specialist species from the early Pliocene metacommunity. This disassembly process was accompanied by the organisation of a diversified metacommunity with an increased importance of biome generalist species, and finally followed by the assembly during the middle–late Pleistocene of a new set of species specialised in the novel environments developed as a consequence of the glaciations.},

These ages can in turn be used to constrain the 449 hominid specimens thus far reported from the basin. Ages for most hominid specimens can be estimated with a precision of ±0.05 my.

	abstract = {Aim

The species–area relationship (SAR) is often modelled by the linearized power function log S = log c + z log A, where S is species richness, A is area, logc is the intercept and z is the slope. Although investigating how c and z values vary across taxa and archipelagos can provide insights into the biology of the SAR, this approach has many caveats. In this study, we aim to clarify how and why SARs should be properly compared for the same taxon among different areas, or among different taxa in the same area.


Location

Mediterranean. We considered 18–46 Tyrrhenian islands (0.000024–223 km2) and 32–65 Aegean islands (0.0058–8261 km2).


Methods

We used OLS regressions to estimate c and z values for various taxonomic groups: land snails, isopods, centipedes, tenebrionids and reptiles. We used ANCOVAs to test (1) if different taxa have different z and c values within the same island group (possibly due to their dispersal ability and ecological characteristics), and (2) if the same taxon has different z and c values in different island groups (possibly due to differences in historical processes and isolation).


Results

z varied between 0.141 and 0.309, while c varied between 2.717 and 12.286 species per unit area (1 km2). For tenebrionids, centipedes and land snails, we found higher c values in the Tyrrhenian islands than in the Aegean islands. Overall, c values were highest for land snails.


Main conclusions

Our results demonstrate the importance of comparing SARs either of different groups within the same area, or of the same group in different areas. Furthermore, we identify the intercept, rather than the slope, as being dependent on the biogeographical dynamics (relict versus equilibrium faunas) and species ecology (dispersal capabilities and population abundance).},

Two theoretical approaches for interpreting hominid paleoneurological data are discussed: (1) identifying cerebral “rubicons” that theoretically distinguish hominids from other primates and (2) analyzing brain evolution in terms of “residual” encephalization factors that remain after body size factors have been accounted for. Although these two approaches are scientific, much of the literature on human brain evolution is speculative—i.e., based on efforts to identify “prime movers,” such as hunting or warfare, that theoretically were responsible for the marked increase in both absolute and relative brain size that occurred during hominid evolution. The search for rubicons has been unfruitful. Features that distinguish hominid from pongid brains seem to be the result of allometry (i.e., determined by brain size) rather than the result of selection for qualitatively different neurological features. However, this finding may simply reflect the crude nature of the paleoneurological evidence. Thus, the field of comparative neurology is more likely than paleoneurology to contribute to our knowledge of the details of human brain evolution.},

	abstract = {Present-day African ecosystems serve as referential models for conceptualizing the environmental context of early hominin evolution, but the degree to which modern ecosystems are representative of those in the past is unclear. A growing body of evidence from eastern Africa’s rich and well-dated late Cenozoic fossil record documents communities of large-bodied mammalian herbivores with ecological structures differing dramatically from those of the present day, implying that modern communities may not be suitable analogs for the ancient ecosystems of hominin evolution. To determine when and why the ecological structure of eastern Africa’s herbivore faunas came to resemble those of the present, here we analyze functional trait changes in a comprehensive dataset of 305 modern and fossil herbivore communities spanning the last ∼7 Myr. We show that nearly all communities prior to ∼700 ka were functionally non-analog, largely due to a greater richness of non-ruminants and megaherbivores (species {\textgreater}1,000 kg). The emergence of functionally modern communities precedes that of taxonomically modern communities by 100,000s of years, and can be attributed to the combined influence of Plio-Pleistocene C
              4
              grassland expansion and pulses of aridity after ∼1 Ma. Given the disproportionate ecological impacts of large-bodied herbivores on factors such as vegetation structure, hydrology, and fire regimes, it follows that the vast majority of early hominin evolution transpired in the context of ecosystems that functioned unlike any today. Identifying how past ecosystems differed compositionally and functionally from those today is key to conceptualizing ancient African environments and testing ecological hypotheses of hominin evolution.},

	abstract = {A large body of research provides reconstructions of ancient water deficit—the difference between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation—using an aridity index derived from the δ18O values of tooth enamel from evaporation sensitive (ES) and evaporation insensitive (EI) mammalian herbivores. The former are typically ruminants that obtain most of their water from leafy dicots (the δ18O of their enamel reflects evaporation of leaf water), whereas the latter are non-ruminants dependent on surface water (the δ18O of their enamel reflects local meteoric water). Use of the index requires that fossil taxa are correctly classified as ES or EI. This study examines how paleodietary change can influence such classifications. In modern ruminant ungulates, dependence on drinking water is related to the proportion of grass versus dicots in the diet. This means that paleodietary change in ruminant ungulates should be associated with shifts in drinking behavior, altering enamel δ18O values and biasing the aridity index. Such bias is evident in estimates of water deficit derived from the enrichment of enamel δ18O in fossil Tragelaphini relative to Hippopotamidae from East African fossil sites spanning the last {\textasciitilde}4.4Myr. Elevated grass consumption (measured by enamel δ13C) in the former is associated with reduced enrichment of enamel δ18O relative to the latter, translating to lower estimates of water deficit. In conducting such analyses of fossil ungulates, the diet of those ungulates must be screened to ensure consistency with the assumptions of the method.},

Although the measurement of evenness is commonplace, there are numerous challenges involved. Evenness indices are sensitive to changing richness, and by extension sample size, and various indices respond differently to changing taxonomic abundances (i.e., changing evenness). To refine protocol for comparing assemblages of varied sampling effort and identify indices that may be more useful for zooarchaeological applications, we examine the quantitative behavior of the widely used Shannon evenness and Simpson indices and two others more commonly used by ecologists. These indices are examined in relation to varied richness, sample size, and taxonomic abundances. We show that although zooarchaeologists are concerned with identifying and correcting for the effects of sample size on evenness, it may be appropriate to instead focus on how richness modulates evenness. Based on our analyses, we recommend the Simpson index for most zooarchaeological applications, except when comparing evenness across assemblages that are very even.},

The latter is markedly influenced by energy availability and appears to be influenced more by common species than rare ones; species–energy relationships should thus be stronger for common species. Species–energy relationships may arise because high-energy areas support more individuals, and these larger populations may buffer species from extinction. As extinction risk is a negative decelerating function of population size, this more-individuals hypothesis (MIH) predicts that rare species should respond more strongly to energy. We investigate these opposing predictions using British breeding bird data and find that, contrary to the MIH, common species contribute more to species–energy relationships than rare ones.},

	abstract = {Correlations between the amount of energy received by an assemblage and the number of species that it contains are very general, and at the macro-scale such species–energy relationships typically follow a monotonically increasing curve. Whilst the ecological literature contains frequent reports of such relationships, debate on their causal mechanisms is limited and typically focuses on the role of energy availability in controlling the number of individuals in an assemblage. Assemblages from high-energy areas may contain more individuals enabling species to maintain larger, more viable populations, whose lower extinction risk elevates species richness. Other mechanisms have, however, also been suggested. Here we identify and clarify nine principal mechanisms that may generate positive species–energy relationships at the macro-scale. We critically assess their assumptions and applicability over a range of spatial scales, derive predictions for each and assess the evidence that supports or refutes them. Our synthesis demonstrates that all mechanisms share at least one of their predictions with an alternative mechanism. Some previous studies of species–energy relationships appear not to have recognised the extent of shared predictions, and this may detract from their contribution to the debate on causal mechanisms. The combination of predictions and assumptions made by each mechanism is, however, unique, suggesting that, in principle, conclusive tests are possible. Sufficient testing of all mechanisms has yet to be conducted, and no single mechanism currently has unequivocal support. Each may contribute to species–energy relationships in some circumstances, but some mechanisms are unlikely to act simultaneously. Moreover, a limited number appear particularly likely to contribute frequently to species–energy relationships at the macro-scale. The increased population size, niche position and diversification rate mechanisms are particularly noteworthy in this context.},

Using the unparalleled fossil record of Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, we demonstrate that macroevolutionary dynamics depend on the interaction between species’ ecology and the changing climate. This interplay drives diversification but differs between speciation probability and extinction risk: Speciation was more strongly shaped by diversity dependence than by climate change, whereas the reverse was true for extinction. Crucially, no single ecology was optimal in all environments, and species with distinct ecologies had significantly different probabilities of speciation and extinction. The ensuing macroevolutionary dynamics depend fundamentally on the ecological structure of species’ assemblages.},

	abstract = {Patterns in food-web structure have frequently been examined in static food webs, but few studies have attempted to delineate patterns that materialize in food webs under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, using one of nature's classical nonequilibrium systems as the food-web database, we test the major assumptions of recent advances in food-web theory. We show that a complex web of interactions between insect herbivores and their natural enemies displays significant architectural flexibility over a large fluctuation in the natural abundance of the major herbivore, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Importantly, this flexibility operates precisely in the manner predicted by recent foraging-based food-web theories: higher-order mobile generalists respond rapidly in time and space by converging on areas of increasing prey abundance. This “birdfeeder effect” operates such that increasing budworm densities correspond to a cascade of increasing diversity and food-web complexity. Thus, by integrating foraging theory with food-web ecology and analyzing a long-term, natural data set coupled with manipulative field experiments, we are able to show that food-web structure varies in a predictable manner. Furthermore, both recent food-web theory and longstanding foraging theory suggest that this very same food-web flexibility ought to be a potent stabilizing mechanism. Interestingly, we find that this food-web flexibility tends to be greater in heterogeneous than in homogeneous forest plots. Because our results provide a plausible mechanism for boreal forest effects on populations of forest insect pests, they have implications for forest and pest management practices.},

Usually, researchers study how a few properties are affected by one factor in isolation and at one scale. Hence, there are few multi-scale studies testing how multiple controlling factors simultaneously affect community properties at different scales. We ask whether climate, habitat structure, or insect resources at each of three spatial scales explains most of the variation in six community properties and which theory best explains the distribution of selected community properties across a rainfall gradient. We studied a Neotropical insectivorous bat ensemble in the Isthmus of Panama with acoustic monitoring techniques. Using climatological data, habitat surveys, and insect captures in a hierarchical sampling design we determined how much variation of the community properties was explained by the three factors employing two approaches for variance partitioning. Our results revealed that most of the variation in species richness, total abundance, and feeding activity occurred at the smallest spatial scale and was explained by habitat structure. In contrast, climate at large scales explained most of the variation in individual species' abundances. Although each species had an idiosyncratic response to the gradient, species richness peaked at intermediate levels of precipitation, whereas total abundance was very similar across sites, suggesting density compensation. All community properties responded in a different manner to the factor and scale under consideration.},

	abstract = {The Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction was associated with a collapse in the carbon isotopic (δ13C) gradient between planktonic and benthic foraminifera and a decrease in bulk carbonate δ13C values. These perturbations have been explained by several hypotheses: global collapse of primary productivity (Strangelove Ocean); greatly reduced export but not primary productivity (Living Ocean); little or no reduction in export productivity (Resilient Ocean); and geographic heterogeneity in the change of export productivity (Heterogeneous Ocean). We tested primary vs. export productivity changes in the paleoshelf of New Jersey, where δ13C values and organic carbon accumulation rates can distinguish among different ocean responses. On the shelf, the K/Pg boundary is associated with a {\textasciitilde}2.5‰ δ13C decrease in bulk carbonate, a {\textasciitilde}0.8‰ δ13C decrease in organic carbon, a collapse of the surface to bottom δ13C gradient, and a drop in organic carbon percentage. We interpret an early Danian {\textasciitilde}1.0‰ planktonic foraminiferal δ13C gradient, a {\textasciitilde}0.75‰ cross-shelf benthic foraminiferal δ13C gradient, and a drop in carbon accumulation rates to reflect the presence of active primary but limited export productivity, consistent with the Living Ocean hypothesis. We evaluated interbasinal deep-sea benthic foraminiferal δ13C gradients between the Pacific (Site 1210) and the Atlantic (Site 1262) oceans as a proxy for changes in export productivity. The interbasinal δ13C gradient was reduced after the mass extinction, suggesting a reduction in global export productivity. Although our data support the Living Ocean hypothesis, evidence from paleo-upwelling zones shows significant export productivity, indicating spatial heterogeneity in the wake of the K/Pg mass extinction (Heterogeneous Ocean).},

The variance in the lognormal species abundance distribution is partitioned into components expressing the heterogeneity between the species, independent noise components for the different species, a demographic stochastic component, and a component due to overdispersion in the sampling. In disagreement with the neutral theory, the estimates show that the heterogeneity component is the dominating one, representing 81\% of the total variance in the lognormal model. Different spatial components of diversity, the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, are also estimated. The spatial scale of the autocorrelation function for the community is of order 1 km, while sampling of a quadrat would need to be 10 km on a side to yield the total diversity for the community.},

However, all the about 16 million fixed genetic changes that occurred during human evolution are fully correlated with all molecular, cellular, anatomical and behavioral changes that occurred during this time. Hence, as humans and chimpanzees cannot be crossed or genetically manipulated, no direct evidence for linking particular genetic and molecular changes to human brain evolution can be obtained. Here, I sketch a framework how indirect evidence can be obtained and review findings related to the molecular basis of human cognition, vocal learning and brain size. In particular, I discuss how a comprehensive comparative approach, leveraging cellular systems and genomic technologies, could inform the evolution of our brain in the future.},

	abstract = {One of the distinguishing features of Homo sapiens is its absolutely and relatively large brain. This feature is also seen in less extreme form in some fossil Homo species. However, are increases in brain size during the Plio-Pleistocene only seen in Homo, and is brain enlargement among Plio-Pleistocene primates confined to hominins? This study examines evidence for changes in brain size for species and lineage samples of three synchronic East African fossil primate groups, the two hominin genera Homo and Paranthropus, and the cercopithecoid genusTheropithecus . Hominin endocranial capacity data were taken from the literature, but it was necessary to develop an indirect method for estimating the endocranial volume of Theropithecus. Bivariate and multivariate regression equations relating measured endocranial volume to three external cranial dimensions were developed from a large (ca. 340) sample of modern African cercopithecoids. These equations were used to estimate the endocranial volumes of 20 Theropithecus specimens from the African Plio-Pleistocene. Spearman's rho and the Hubert nonparametric test were used to search for evidence of temporal trends in both the hominin and Theropithecus data. Endocranial volume apparently increased over time in bothHomo and Paranthropus boisei, but there was no evidence for temporal trends in the endocranial volume ofTheropithecus . Thus, hypotheses which suggest a mix of environmental, social, dietary, or other factors as catalysts for increasing brain in Plio-Pleistocene primates must accommodate evidence of brain enlargement in both Homo andParanthropus , and explain why this phenomenon appears to be restricted to hominins.},

	abstract = {* 1Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions.
* 2This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion.
* 3Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods.
* 4The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analysing whether evolutionary history—represented by taxonomic classification—provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxonomic ranks (kingdom to class). Our methods provide a way to explicitly include evolutionary history in models for food web structure.},

	abstract = {Despite the exceptional complexity formed by species and their interactions in ecological networks, such as food webs, regularities in the network structures are repeatedly demonstrated. The interactions are determined by the characteristics of a species. The characteristics are in turn determined by the species’ phylogenetic relationships, but also by factors not related to evolutionary history. Here, we test whether species’ phylogenetic relationships provides a significant proxy for food web intervality. We thereafter quantify the degree to which different species traits remain valuable predictors of food web structure after the baseline effect of species’ relatedness has been removed. We find that the phylogenetic relationships provide a significant background from which to estimate food web intervality and thereby structure. However, we also find that there is an important, non-negligible part of some traits, e.g., body size, in food webs that is not accounted for by the phylogenetic relationships. Additionally, both these relationships differ depending if a predator or a prey perspective is adopted. Clearly, species’ evolutionary history as well as traits not determined by phylogenetic relationships shapes predator-prey interactions in food webs, and the underlying evolutionary processes take place on slightly different time scales depending on the direction of predator-prey adaptations.},

Further that even relativising it to an observer has problems. It is proposed that complexity can be only usefully applied to constructions within a given language. It is argued that complexity is usefully differentiated from the concepts of size, ignorance, variety, minimum description length and order. A definition of complexity is proposed which can be summarised as follows: That property of a language expression which makes it difficult to formulate its overall behaviour even when given almost complete information about its atomic components and their inter-relations.. Some of the consequences of this definition are discussed. It is shown that this definition encompasses several existing varieties of complexity measures and is then applied to some examples pertaining to the evolution of complex' systems including: "What is the complexity that has evolved in organisms and has it increased?".},

	abstract = {The identification of randomness and nonrandomness is a perennial problem in evolutionary research. Stochastic thinking in evolutionary biology and paleobiology has solidified the use of a statistical notion of chance, but the idea of chance in evolutionary studies goes beyond statistics. A duality arises from the use of a statistical meaning on the one hand, and a more strictly evolutionary meaning on the other. The former implies a combination of indiscriminate sampling and unpredictability due to multiple causes; the latter codifies independence from adaptation and the directionality imposed by natural selection. Often these meanings are kept separate in evolutionary research, used in isolation according to the empirical situation or the goal of the investigator (recognition of pattern versus process). I argue that evolutionary studies in general and paleobiological studies in particular can benefit from the simultaneous application of statistical and evolutionary notions of chance. Following some background on the notion of chance and its use, I discuss a series of examples in which insight can be gained by explicit consideration of both meanings. Thus, typologies of extinction become clearer when phenomena like wanton extinction are made explicit; exaptive radiations are exposed as an alternative to adaptive radiations; the possible non-adaptive nature of deterministic chaos becomes sensible; the nonrandomness of community-assembly is put into question; parallel taxonomies of sorting rooted in different notions of nonrandomness are suggested as a means of facilitating understanding of relationships across the hierarchy; developmental constraints and self-organization are more easily distinguished from selective constraints; and a new term, "incidentals," is suggested to refer to both exaptations and nonaptations. Finally, I point to ways in which the dichotomy between chance and necessity can be approached in evolutionary theory, by showing that the dual nature of chance in evolution entails a distinction between functional and structural necessity, and that chance ultimately becomes a unifying concept for a number of criticisms to neo-Darwinism.},

Our analyses of site frequency spectra indicate that these populations derive 2 to 19\% of their genetic ancestry from an archaic population that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans. Using a method that can identify segments of archaic ancestry without the need for reference archaic genomes, we built genome-wide maps of archaic ancestry in the Yoruba and the Mende populations. Analyses of these maps reveal segments of archaic ancestry at high frequency in these populations that represent potential targets of adaptive introgression. Our results reveal the substantial contribution of archaic ancestry in shaping the gene pool of present-day West African populations.},

This survey revealed the presence of a significant rift structure beneath the lake, the extent and structural details of which had been previously unknown. The lake is underlain by a series of half-graben basins which alternate in polarity along the axis of the lake, and are linked end to end by zones of structural high. These half-graben often have Quaternary volcanic centers located near their latitudinal midpoints. Half-graben basins beneath Turkana deepen progressively to the north, attaining thicknesses of up to 4 km. A deep seismic reflector has been identified, and is believed to correspond to the top of a thick series of Mio-Pliocene flood volcanics. Overlying reflectors are thought to correspond to fluvial, lacustrine and volcano-clastic sediments that are Plio-Pleistocene to Recent in age. The style of rifting beneath Lake Turkana is similar to that observed beneath Lake Tanganyika, which occupies a portion of the Western Branch of the East African Rift System. The most noticeable differences are the abundant volcanism and smaller half-graben size associated with Lake Turkana. These differences may be attributed to the warmer, thinner lithosphere underlying the Eastern Branch as compared to that underlying the Western Branch.},

However, recent analyses suggest that it may have been the particular demands of the more intense forms of pairbonding that was the critical factor that triggered this evolutionary development. This may explain why primate sociality seems to be so different from that found in most other birds and mammals: Primate sociality is based on bonded relationships of a kind that are found only in pairbonds in other taxa.},

	abstract = {The loss of a species from an ecological community can set up a cascade of secondary extinctions that in the worst case could lead to the collapse of the community. Both deterministic and stochastic mechanisms may be involved in such secondary extinctions. To investigate the extent of secondary extinctions in ecological communities following the loss of a species, we here develop a community viability analysis. We introduce a measure called the “quasi-collapse risk” that is defined as the probability that the number of species in a community falls below some defined value within a fixed period of time following the loss of a species. We develop deterministic and stochastic methods for finding post-extinction communities. We use these methods to investigate the relationship between diversity (species richness) and quasi-collapse risks in model communities. It is shown that, in a deterministic context, communities with more species within trophic levels have a larger fraction of species remaining in post-extinction communities. This benefit of species richness is to a large extent lost in the presence of demographic stochasticity. The reason for this is a negative relationship between population density and species diversity. We also show that communities become increasingly triangular in shape as secondary extinctions take place, due to greater extinction risk of species at higher trophic levels. We argue that this new approach holds some promise for identifying fragile ecosystems and keystone species.},

But because experiments rarely incorporate natural variation in environmental factors and biodiversity, conditions determining the relative strength of bottom–up and top–down forcing remain unresolved. We factorially added nutrients and reduced grazing at 15 sites across the range of the marine foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina) to quantify how top–down and bottom–up control interact with natural gradients in biodiversity and environmental forcing. Experiments confirmed modest top–down control of algae, whereas fertilisation had no general effect. Unexpectedly, grazer and algal biomass were better predicted by cross-site variation in grazer and eelgrass diversity than by global environmental gradients. Moreover, these large-scale patterns corresponded strikingly with prior small-scale experiments. Our results link global and local evidence that biodiversity and top–down control strongly influence functioning of threatened seagrass ecosystems, and suggest that biodiversity is comparably important to global change stressors.},

	abstract = {Analyses of stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) from herbivore dental enamel and paleosol carbonates are important tools for Plio-Pleistocene paleovegetation reconstructions. A single herbivore tooth documents an isotopic record of vegetation on the order of 10–1–1 years and in proportion to that individual's foraging range. Paleosol carbonates, conversely, record environmental information on longer time scales (102–3 years) but smaller spatial scales (101 m2). Given that these two proxies document paleoenvironments at different spatiotemporal scales, it is worth comparing them to see if they offer redundant or complementary paleovegetation information. Here, we compare δ13C patterns from herbivore enamel and paleosol carbonates from geological (sub)members in the Awash Valley, Ethiopia, and Turkana Basin, Kenya, from {\textasciitilde} 4.4–1 million years ago. We find that median herbivore enamel δ13C is typically {\textasciitilde} 5–7 per mil (‰) higher than that from paleosol carbonates within a given (sub)member. The distributions of paleosol carbonate δ13C values usually have less spread (variation) than herbivore enamel. The bias in median and spread between these two data types likely reflects the different spatial and temporal scales at which these proxies record paleoenvironmental information. Most Plio-Pleistocene fossiliferous deposits are formed in fluvial settings in which paleosol carbonates sample the immediate habitat of floodplain woodlands and shrubs, resulting in a lower δ13C (i.e., more C3) signal. On the other hand, fossil teeth of wide-ranging herbivores could generate a higher (i.e., more C4) and more variable δ13C signal if some taxa fed in floodplain woodlands while others fed on open grasslands distal to the floodplain. We conclude that δ13C values from herbivore enamel and paleosol carbonates offer paleovegetation data at different spatiotemporal scales, both of which are informative for hominin habitat reconstructions. Careful consideration of the spatial and temporal signals inherent in these and other proxies should be applied in future studies.},

	abstract = {One of the most crucial debates in human paleoneurology concerns the timing and mode of the emergence of the derived cerebral features in the hominin fossil record. Given its exceptional degree of preservation and geological age (i.e., 3.67 Ma), StW 573 (‘Little Foot’) has the potential to shed new light on hominin brain evolution. Here we present the first detailed comparative description of the external neuroanatomy of StW 573. The endocast was virtually reconstructed and compared to ten southern African hominin specimens from Makapansgat, Malapa, Sterkfontein and Swartkrans attributed to Australopithecus and Paranthropus. We apply an automatic method for the detection of sulcal and vascular imprints. The endocranial surface of StW 573 is crushed and plastically deformed in a number of locations. The uncorrected and therefore minimum cranial capacity estimate is 408 cm3 and plots at the lower end of Australopithecus variation. The endocast of StW 573 approximates the rostrocaudally elongated and dorsoventrally flattened endocranial shape seen in Australopithecus and displays a distinct left occipital petalia. StW 573 and the comparative early hominin specimens share a similar sulcal pattern in the inferior region of the frontal lobes that also resembles the pattern observed in extant chimpanzees. The presumed lunate sulcus in StW 573 is located above the sigmoid sinus, as in extant chimpanzees, while it is more caudally positioned in SK 1585 and StW 505. The middle branch of the middle meningeal vessels derives from the anterior branch, as in MH 1, MLD 37/38, StW 578. Overall, the cortical anatomy of StW 573 displays a less derived condition compared to the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene southern African hominins (e.g., StW 505, SK 1585).},

Global mean trait increase is 2.5 cm per degree of equatorial distance. The interactive geometry between cranial size and shape is described, with encephalization and brachycephalization considered as functionally connected trends. Breadth is the most important structural component determining capacity. Relations between body size and brain size indicate that human populations under severe cold stress obtain large volumes more from rounder cranial shape than from differentiation by total body size. A computerized mapping program is developed and applied to anthropometric, climatic, and HRAF files. Its potential to produce clinal depictions through the Pleistocene ("time machine project") is discussed. Paleontological data are summarized for 147 hominids.},

The stratigraphic ranges of 838 genera were used in the analyses, revealing a mean generic duration of 12.0 m.y. and a mean species duration of 6.7 m.y., values within the range of longevities reported for other taxa. Further analyses showed differences in evolutionary rates among crinoid taxa: camerate species and genera were shorter-lived than species and genera of flexibles and inadunates. This pattern may result from ecological differences among these taxa: an energy budget equation solved for crinoids with various filter morphologies revealed that crinoids with fine-mesh filters require higher current velocities to supply them with sufficient particulate nutrients than do crinoids with coarsemesh filters. A hypothesis stipulating that these differences control the distribution of crinoids among different environments is supported by patterns of occurrence of Mississippian crinoids: the pinnulate camerates (fine filter) dominate higher energy settings while the non-pinnulate inadunates and flexibles (coarse filter) are found in all environments. The "specialized" pinnulate crinoids may therefore be more prone to speciation and extinction than the non-pinnulate "generalists," thus accounting for the observed differences in the evolutionary rates of the three subclasses. The above hypothesis was tested by comparing evolutionary rates of two morphological groups: fine-filtered crinoids (camerates) and coarse-filtered crinoids (non-pinnulate Paleozoic crinoids). As predicted, fine-filtered taxa had higher extinction and origination rates. A "bootstrapping" technique revealed that the differences in extinction rates were significant at the p {\textless} 0.10 level.},

Analysis of 11 Paleozoic crinoid Lagerstätten revealed a significant increase in arm regeneration during the Siluro-Devonian. During this interval, referred to as the Middle Paleozoic Marine Revolution, the diversity of shell-crushing predators increased, and antipredatory morphologies among invertebrate prey, such as crinoids, became more common. Crinoid arm-regeneration data suggest an increase in nonlethal attacks at this time and represent a causal link between those patterns, which implies an important role for predator-driven evolution.},

	abstract = {* In 2003, 24 presence–absence β-diversity metrics were reviewed and a number of trade-offs and redundancies identified. We present a parallel investigation into the performance of abundance-based metrics of β-diversity.


* β-diversity is a multi-faceted concept, central to spatial ecology. There are multiple metrics available to quantify it: the choice of metric is an important decision.


* We test 16 conceptual properties and two sampling properties of a β-diversity metric: metrics should be 1) independent of α-diversity and 2) cumulative along a gradient of species turnover. Similarity should be 3) probabilistic when assemblages are independently and identically distributed. Metrics should have 4) a minimum of zero and increase monotonically with the degree of 5) species turnover, 6) decoupling of species ranks and 7) evenness differences. However, complete species turnover should always generate greater values of β than extreme 8) rank shifts or 9) evenness differences. Metrics should 10) have a fixed upper limit, 11) symmetry (βA,B = βB,A), 12) double-zero asymmetry for double absences and double presences and 13) not decrease in a series of nested assemblages. Additionally, metrics should be independent of 14) species replication 15) the units of abundance and 16) differences in total abundance between sampling units. When samples are used to infer β-diversity, metrics should be 1) independent of sample sizes and 2) independent of unequal sample sizes. We test 29 metrics for these properties and five ‘personality’ properties.


* Thirteen metrics were outperformed or equalled across all conceptual and sampling properties. Differences in sensitivity to species’ abundance lead to a performance trade-off between sample size bias and the ability to detect turnover among rare species. In general, abundance-based metrics are substantially less biased in the face of undersampling, although the presence–absence metric, βsim, performed well overall. Only βBaselga R turn, βBaselga B-C turn and βsim measured purely species turnover and were independent of nestedness. Among the other metrics, sensitivity to nestedness varied {\textgreater}4-fold.


* Our results indicate large amounts of redundancy among existing β-diversity metrics, whilst the estimation of unseen shared and unshared species is lacking and should be addressed in the design of new abundance-based metrics.},

	abstract = {The appearance of Homo erectus shortly after 2.0 Ma is widely considered a turning point in human dietary evolution, with increased consumption of animal tissues driving the evolution of larger brain and body size and a reorganization of the gut. An increase in the size and number of zooarchaeological assemblages after the appearance of H. erectus is often offered as a central piece of archaeological evidence for increased carnivory in this species, but this characterization has yet to be subject to detailed scrutiny. Any widespread dietary shift leading to the acquisition of key traits in H. erectus should be persistent in the zooarchaeological record through time and can only be convincingly demonstrated by a broad-scale analysis that transcends individual sites or localities. Here, we present a quantitative synthesis of the zooarchaeological record of eastern Africa from 2.6 to 1.2 Ma. We show that several proxies for the prevalence of hominin carnivory are all strongly related to how well the fossil record has been sampled, which constrains the zooarchaeological visibility of hominin carnivory. When correcting for sampling effort, there is no sustained increase in the amount of evidence for hominin carnivory between 2.6 and 1.2 Ma. Our observations undercut evolutionary narratives linking anatomical and behavioral traits to increased meat consumption in H. erectus, suggesting that other factors are likely responsible for the appearance of its human-like traits.},

	abstract = {Earth's most recent major extinction episode, the Quaternary Megafauna Extinction, claimed two-thirds of mammal genera and one-half of species that weighed {\textgreater}44 kg between ≈50,000 and 3,000 years ago. Estimates of megafauna biomass (including humans as a megafauna species) for before, during, and after the extinction episode suggest that growth of human biomass largely matched the loss of non-human megafauna biomass until ≈12,000 years ago. Then, total megafauna biomass crashed, because many non-human megafauna species suddenly disappeared, whereas human biomass continued to rise. After the crash, the global ecosystem gradually recovered into a new state where megafauna biomass was concentrated around one species, humans, instead of being distributed across many species. Precrash biomass levels were finally reached just before the Industrial Revolution began, then skyrocketed above the precrash baseline as humans augmented the energy available to the global ecosystem by mining fossil fuels. Implications include (i) an increase in human biomass (with attendant hunting and other impacts) intersected with climate change to cause the Quaternary Megafauna Extinction and an ecological threshold event, after which humans became dominant in the global ecosystem; (ii) with continued growth of human biomass and today's unprecedented global warming, only extraordinary and stepped-up conservation efforts will prevent a new round of extinctions in most body-size and taxonomic spectra; and (iii) a near-future biomass crash that will unfavorably impact humans and their domesticates and other species is unavoidable unless alternative energy sources are developed to replace dwindling supplies of fossil fuels.},

	abstract = {More than 40 years of scientific investigations of the hominin bearing Plio-Pleistocene sediments of northern Tanzania have provided a number of paleobotanical data, which, taken as a whole, provide today a way to investigate vegetation changes between 4 and 1 Ma, at a time when our early ancestors emerged. Here, I have integrated the data from all vegetation proxies obtained for the paleontological sites of Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj (i.e. macroscopic plant remains, pollen and phytolith assemblages, carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios measured on carbonates, and organic biomarkers). This important, yet discontinuous botanical record suggests some similarities between past and present-day vegetation at the regional scale: Afromontane forests with Olea, Podocarpus, Juniperus, Hagenia abyssinica in the highlands, and wooded grasslands with grasses and drought-adapted Acacia, Commiphora, Capparidaceae, and Chenopodiaceae and/or Amaranthaceae in the lowlands were present in the southern Serengeti–Crater Highlands region since 4 Ma. Grasses of the C4 photosynthetic type made their first appearance in the record at ∼3.7 Ma, i.e. during the mid-Pliocene, ∼700 ky before major pCO2 and temperature decline. C4 grasses became dominant in the vegetation soon after (∼3.66 Ma), probably in response to reduced precipitation. At ∼2.6 Ma, phytolith and isotope indicate grassland with abundant C4 xerophytic grasses that document strong aridity during the Intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation period (∼2.7–2.5 Ma). After 2 Ma, the detailed and diverse record at Olduvai indicates complex vegetation patterns linked to oscillating precipitation, varying lake levels, and the presence of geological faults. Hence, despite low (basin-averaged) reconstructed paleo-precipitation amounts of ∼250–700 mm/y, C4-grasslands, closed woodlands, wetlands, and palm-groves co-occurred on short spatial scales near saline Lake Olduvai. Freshwater wetlands and palm-rich woodlands occurred in highly localized areas on the lake margins, where aquifer barriers and/or outcrops caused by geologic faults allowed groundwater discharge. Botanical evidence of paleo-springs at Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj includes the marked presence of Typha (cattail) and Hyphaene (palm tree) in association with Acacia pollen grains, and (at Olduvai) abundant forest indicator phytoliths and organic and isotopic biomarkers. At Olduvai, freshwater wetlands were most developed when lake level and fluvial competence where low, i.e. during dry periods. When wet–dry climate variability was extreme in East Africa (∼1.9–1.7 Ma), freshwater springs may therefore have offered a sustainable habitat (i.e. refuge) for several species, including hominins, and favored hominin and artifact concentration at these specific places, particularly during environmentally stressful times.},

	abstract = {Predator–prey body size relationships influence food chain length, trophic structure, transfer efficiency, interaction strength, and the bioaccumulation of contaminants. Improved quantification of these relationships and their response to the environment is needed to parameterize food web models and describe food web structure and function. A compiled data set comprising 29 582 records of individual prey eaten at 21 locations by individual predators that spanned 10 orders of magnitude in mass and lived in marine environments ranging from the poles to the tropics was used to investigate the influence of predator size and environment on predator and prey size relationships. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that predator–prey mass ratios (PPMR) increased with predator mass. The amount of the increase varied among locations and predator species and individuals but was not significantly influenced by temperature, latitude, depth, or primary production. Increases in PPMR with predator mass implied nonlinear relationships between log body mass and trophic level and reductions in transfer efficiency with increasing body size. The results suggest that very general rules determine dominant trends in PPMR in diverse marine ecosystems, leading to the ubiquity of size-based trophic structuring and the consistency of observed relationships between the relative abundance of individuals and their body size.},

The number of species always increases from high stress to variable nearshore to open marine environments. Within-habitat variation in number of species is small for long intervals of the Phanerozoic. The median number of species in communities from high stress environments remains fixed at about 8 from the Cambrian to the Pleistocene. In open marine environments, the median is near 30 for the Middle and Upper Paleozoic and almost the same for the Mesozoic. Increases of 50\% in median number of species between the Lower and Middle Paleozoic and 2 times between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic occur in open marine environments with parallel, but less pronounced, increases in variable nearshore environments. Conditions controlling overall within-habitat species richness changed at those times. These changes do not correlate directly with evolution of new major taxa, change in physical conditions, predation, space availability or oxygen supply. They may be related to changes in resource availability influenced by factors such as the developing terrestrial flora, to lag-time inherent in the evolutionary process of diversification, or to as yet undetermined factors. Although provinciality determines total species richness for the biosphere, the within-habitat data suggest that the number of marine invertebrate species in the world has increased since the Middle Paleozoic, contrary to Raup's (1976b) contention, but possibly only by about 4 times, not the order of magnitude or more suggested by Valentine (1970).},

	abstract = {The distribution of numbers of species and the median number of species from 386 selected fossil communities are tabulated for high stress, variable nearshore, and open marine environments during the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleozoic, the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. The number of species always increases from high stress to variable nearshore to open marine environments. Within-habitat variation in number of species is small for long intervals of the Phanerozoic. The median number of species in communities from high stress environments remains fixed at about 8 from the Cambrian to the Pleistocene. In open marine environments, the median is near 30 for the Middle and Upper Paleozoic and almost the same for the Mesozoic. Increases of 50\% in median number of species between the Lower and Middle Paleozoic and 2 times between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic occur in open marine environments with parallel, but less pronounced, increases in variable nearshore environments. Conditions controlling overall within-habitat species richness changed at those times. These changes do not correlate directly with evolution of new major taxa, change in physical conditions, predation, space availability or oxygen supply. They may be related to changes in resource availability influenced by factors such as the developing terrestrial flora, to lag-time inherent in the evolutionary process of diversification, or to as yet undetermined factors. Although provinciality determines total species richness for the biosphere, the within-habitat data suggest that the number of marine invertebrate species in the world has increased since the Middle Paleozoic, contrary to Raup's (1976b) contention, but possibly only by about 4 times, not the order of magnitude or more suggested by Valentine (1970).},

We discuss some recent occupancy estimation methods and the biological systems that motivated their development. Collectively, these models offer tremendous flexibility, but simultaneously place added demands on the investigator. Unlike many mark–recapture scenarios, investigators utilizing occupancy models have the ability, and responsibility, to define their sample units (i.e. sites), replicate sampling occasions, time period over which species occurrence is assumed to be static and even the criteria that constitute ‘detection’ of a target species. Subsequent biological inference and interpretation of model parameters depend on these definitions and the ability to meet model assumptions. We demonstrate the relevance of these definitions by highlighting applications from a single biological system (an amphibian–pathogen system) and discuss situations where the use of occupancy models has been criticized. Finally, we use these applications to suggest future research and model development.},

	abstract = {Additional DNA sequence information from a range of primates, including 13.7 kb from pygmy chimpanzee (Pan paniscus), was added to data sets of β-globin gene cluster sequence alignments that span the γ1, γ2, and ψη loci and their flanking and intergenic regions. This enlarged body of data was used to address the issue of whether the ancestral separations of gorilla, chimpanzee, and human lineages resulted from only one trichotomous branching or from two dichotomous branching events. The degree of divergence, corrected for super-imposed substitutions, seen in the β-globin gene cluster between human alleles is about a third to a half that observed between two species of chimpanzee and about a fourth that between human and chimpanzee. The divergence either between chimpanzee and gorilla or between human and gorilla is slightly greater than that between human and chimpanzee, suggesting that the ancestral separations resulted from two closely spaced dichotomous branchings. Maximum parsimony analysis further strengthened the evidence that humans and chimpanzees share the longest common ancestry. Support for this human-chimpanzee clade is statistically significant at P = 0.002 over a human-gorilla clade or a chimpanzee-gorilla clade. An analysis of expected and observed homoplasy revealed that the number of sequence changes uniquely shared by human and chimpanzee lineages is too large to be attributed to homoplasy. Molecular clock calculations that accommodated lineage variations in rates of molecular evolution yielded hominoid branching times that ranged from 17–19 million years ago (MYA) for the separation of gibbon from the other hominoids to 5–7 MYA for the separation of chimpanzees from humans. Based on the relatively late dates and mounting corroborative evidence from unlinked nuclear genes and mitochondrial DNA for the close sister grouping of humans and chimpanzees, a cladistic classification would place all apes and humans in the same family. Within this family, gibbons would be placed in one subfamily and all other extant hominoids in another subfamily. The later subfamily would be divided into a tribe for orangutans and another tribe for gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. Finally, gorillas would be placed in one subtribe with chimpanzees and humans in another, although this last division is not as strongly supported as the other divisions.},

	abstract = {Classical theory shows that large communities are destabilized by random interactions among species pairs, creating an upper bound on ecosystem diversity. However, species interactions often occur in high-order combinations, whereby the interaction between two species is modulated by one or more other species. Here, by simulating the dynamics of communities with random interactions, we find that the classical relationship between diversity and stability is inverted for high-order interactions. More specifically, while a community becomes more sensitive to pairwise interactions as its number of species increases, its sensitivity to three-way interactions remains unchanged, and its sensitivity to four-way interactions actually decreases. Therefore, while pairwise interactions lead to sensitivity to the addition of species, four-way interactions lead to sensitivity to species removal, and their combination creates both a lower and an upper bound on the number of species. These findings highlight the importance of high-order species interactions in determining the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {We compare the taphonomy of vertebrate assemblages from two long continental records—the early Paleogene of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, and the Neogene Siwalik sequence of northern Pakistan. Both sequences contain a similar array of fluvial facies, and the abundance of these facies differs among formations. We document environments of preservation of vertebrate localities over time to determine comparability of fossil assemblages within and between sequences. Changes in sample size and species richness are noted to reveal potential sampling effects on patterns of faunal turnover. Preservational history determined the environment, sample size, quality of specimens, taxonomic composition, and spatial and temporal resolution of fossil assemblages and thereby the quality of the fossil record and its suitability for further analyses.

In both sequences, changes in prevailing taphonomic processes reflect changes in lithofacies and habitat distribution. Correlated changes are found in fossil productivity, species richness, and faunal composition. Both sequences contain some episodes of apparent faunal change in which appearances and disappearances of rare taxa can be attributed principally to changes in sample size. The Paleogene record has high taxonomic resolution (i.e., to genus or species) for most mammalian fossil remains. Temporal and spatial averaging of Paleogene fossil assemblages changes with lithofacies. The Neogene record has higher taxonomic resolution for remains of small mammals (\&lt;2 kg) than of large mammals. All formations have several fossiliferous facies, with moderate to high degrees of temporal averaging and low to high degrees of spatial averaging.

Different preservational circumstances impose different constraints on paleocological and evolutionary analyses. The best opportunities for paleocommunity reconstruction are provided by high taxonomic resolution, large samples, nd varied environments of preservation. These circumstances are found in limited portions of each record. The best opportunities for documenting evolution within lineages and species-replacement patterns are provided by high taxonomic resolution, high temporal resolution, and consistent preservational context. These taphonomic attributes pertain to the more common Paleogene mammals, particularly from the rich paleosol localities of the Willwood Formation, and to the more common Neogene small mammals from abandoned-channel fills of the Siwalik record.},

	abstract = {* A key challenge for both ecological researchers and biodiversity managers is the measurement and prediction of species richness across spatial scales. Typically, biodiversity is assessed at fine scales (e.g. in quadrats or transects) for practical reasons, but often we are interested in coarser-scale (field, regional, global) diversity issues. Moreover, the pressures affecting biodiversity patterns are often scale specific, making multiscale assessment a crucial methodological priority. As species richness is not additive, it is difficult to translate from the scale of measurement to the scale(s) of interest. A number of methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, but most are too model specific or too rigid to allow general application. Here, we present a general framework (and a specific implementation of it) that allows such scale translations to be performed.


* Building on the intrinsic relationships among patterns of species richness, abundance and spatial turnover, we introduce a framework that links and predicts the profile of the species-area relationship and the species-abundance distributions across scales when a limited number of fine-scale scattered samples are available. Using the correlation in species' abundances between pairs of samples as a function of the distance between them, we are able to link the effects of aggregation, similarity decay, species richness and species abundances across scales.


* Our approach allows one to draw inferences about biodiversity scaling under very general assumptions pertaining to the nature of interactions, the geographical distributions of individuals and ecological processes.


* We demonstrate the accuracy of our predictions using data from two well-studied forest stands and also demonstrate the potential value of such methods by examining the effects of management on farmland insects across scales. The framework has important applications to biodiversity research and conservation practice.},

From the latest Miocene to the Holocene period, three biotic events in the large mammal communities of the western Mediterranean region show significant and robust diversity changes and/or turnover with respect to sampling, and correspond in time to significant pulses of the latest Cenozoic glaciations. The ‘Ruscinian mammal turnover pulse’ represents a major biotic event close to the ‘Messinian salinity crisis’. This can be described more as a turnover than a dispersion event. The pattern of turnover shows a significantly high value of first appearances close to the Mio-Pliocene transition; last appearances were also important but reduced significantly in the following interval. A Southern Hemisphere glaciation event has been related to the Messinian crisis. The second major biotic event corresponds to the so-called ‘Equus-elephant event’ during early Villafranchian time. The relevance of this dispersal event is proved by a marked increase in diversity as a result of a high number of first appearances. Between 3.0 and 2.6 Ma the onset of bi-polar glaciations occurred, followed by glacial-interglacial cycles of moderate amplitude sustained at the orbital periodicity of 41 ka. The last major biotic event was the ‘Galerian mammal turnover pulse’ around 1.0 Ma. This turnover represents an important community reorganization that marks a total rejuvenation of the fauna and is coincident with the arrival of Homo species in the western Mediterranean region. At this time, glacial maxima became more extreme and the dominant periodicity of variation shifted to 100 ka, which is attributed to the massive Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.

	abstract = {Many paleoecological analyses utilize estimates of the relative abundances of taxa in fossil or subfossil assemblages. Such estimates depend upon determination of the number of individuals present or some other measure of the amount of material collected for each taxon. I assess the validity of methods currently used to estimate numbers of individuals per taxon in mammalian assemblages. For any method of counting selected, the underlying assumptions about the probability of association among skeletal elements should correspond to processes of accumulation for the assemblage, as inferred from its taphonomic characteristics. No method is appropriate for all mammalian assemblages. Equating the number of individuals with the number of specimens per taxon is the appropriate method when formerly articulated material has been widely dispersed and has accumulated as isolated specimens. Determining the minimum number of individuals represented by multiple skeletal elements is appropriate when material originally accumulated in articulation. For mammalian assemblages from Middle Siwalik (late Miocene) sediments of Pakistan, different methods of counting are appropriate for assemblages from different sedimentary environments. For assemblages produced by current transport, I counted each specimen as a single individual. For assemblages produced by the activities of predators and scavengers, I determined the minimum number of individuals. Two taphonomic processes that influence the degree of association among skeletal remains are mortality and transport. Taphonomic histories that combine different causes of mortality and different conditions of transport produce fossil assemblages with expected taphonomic characteristics. These include the amount of articulated material, the spatial distribution of specimens, the presence of hydraulic sorting, the frequency of juvenile remains, and patterns of bone damage. Taphonomic characteristics of fossil assemblages do not permit all combinations of mortality and transport to be distinguished. Processes of transport generally obscure taphonomic characteristics imposed by different agents of mortality.},

	abstract = {The fundamental goal of biochronology is ordering taxonomic first and last appearance events. The most useful biochronologic data are of the form "the first appearance event of one taxon predates the last appearance event of a second taxon" (FAE {\textless} LAE). FAE {\textless} LAE data sets are unusually reliable because they converge on a unique solution with greater sampling. The fact that the FAE of one taxon i {\textless} the LAE of another taxon j always can be inferred either if i is found lower than j in a stratigraphic section, or if i and j co-occur in at least one taxonomic list. Thus, FAE {\textless} LAE data accurately synthesize two disparate sources of information: routine biostratigraphic observations and taxonomic lists that may have no stratigraphic context. Appearance event ordination, the new method introduced here, is intended to summarize FAE {\textless} LAE data. The algorithm is founded on the following parsimony criterion: arrangements of FAEs and LAEs should always imply FAEi {\textless} LAEj when this is known, and otherwise imply LAEj {\textless} FAEi whenever possible. The technique differs from others related to correspondence analysis in its use of FAE {\textless} LAE data and explicit definition as a parsimony method. The algorithm is even more unique in that it uses different subsets of FAEi {\textless} LAEj statements at each iterative step, converging on separate sets of scores for the FAEs and LAEs. After arranging either the FAEs or the LAEs on the basis of their scores, the other set of scores can be discarded and the best arrangement of the remaining events can be inferred directly. An analysis of the Plio-Pleistocene mammalian record in the Lake Turkana region is used to illustrate the method. Biochronologic resolution on the order of 0.2-1.5 m.y. is achieved. The Turkana species lists by themselves demonstrate enough FAEi {\textless} LAEj relationships to resolve the basic biochronologic pattern, but stratigraphic information is still of great use.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new means of interpreting the distribution of taxa among taxonomic lists. Traditionally, "similarity" indices have been used to compare lists, and "association" measures have been used to compare taxonomic distributions. It is argued that when sampling regimes are poorly understood, all similarity and association indices are unjustifiable. However, observations that taxa have overlapping (conjunct) or nonoverlapping (disjunct) distributions are universally meaningful. Because greater sampling can only increase the number of known conjunctions and because long lists serve as conjunctional Rosetta Stones, conjunction data sets can be far more reliable than the lists that generate them. One way to account for patterns of conjunction and disjunction is to create theoretical spaces composed of two distributional boundaries or edges for each taxon in each dimension. A parsimonious arrangement of edges implies distributions that always overlap when taxa are conjunct and infrequently overlap when taxa are disjunct. A procedure involving correspondence analysis is shown to minimize the number of implied disjunctions. The method is used to analyze a set of 271 Miocene large-mammal genus lists from the Great Plains region. Biostratigraphic and radiometric data demonstrate that the "best" arrangement of distributional edges is temporal and corresponds to an age-range chart. The edge sequence is calibrated to the radiometric time scale and used to compute a detailed genus-level diversity curve and to redefine the boundaries between Miocene Land-Mammal Ages and Subages in the Great Plains. Each of the Miocene Ages can be divided into two or three Subages. Diversity levels are apparently low throughout the Early Miocene and rise sharply during the Middle Miocene. Significant drops in diversity occurred at about 17.4, 11.6, 8.7, and 6.5 Ma. The base of the Barstovian corresponds to the base of the Middle Miocene, and the Clarendonian straddles the Middle-Late Miocene boundary.},

Recent molecular genetic data show that the majority of microfossil-producing plankton groups harbors substantial cryptic diversity. Here, we examine the effect of cryptic diversity on apparent rates of lineage evolution. By using a theoretical approach, we show that under resource competition, an increasing number of sibling species within a hypothetical lineage leads to an exponential slowdown of the apparent rate of evolution. This mechanism explains both the remarkable variation in apparent rates of evolution observed in marine plankton, as well as the presence of long gradual evolutionary trends.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the context in which the evolution and diversification of early hominins occurred has become one of the core and highly debated subjects in paleoanthropology. Over the past three decades substantial progress has been made due to the proliferation of fieldwork and a consequently expanding fossil record, and development of new methods of analysis. The present study uses data of fossil mammals from the Shungura Formation of Ethiopia, with specimens collected semi-independently by French and American research teams who worked in the southern and northern parts of the Shungura area respectively. We compare these two samples in terms of collection methods, taxonomy, taphonomy, and local environmental differences. The following results were obtained: (1) No major taphonomic differences were observed between the two collections. The effect of a major taphonomic shift that occurred in the middle of Member G (G-13) is observed in both samples and is caused by the important change in the depositional environment from fluvial to lacustrine conditions. (2) The French team collected more specimens than the American team, in part because it had a larger area of exposures, and it spent two extra seasons in the field. Additionally, the French team collected more large-sized taxa including their postcranial elements, while the American team recovered a restricted set of postcranial bones. In contrast, the American team collected more primates and carnivores than the French team. (3) Despite these differences, comparable taxonomic composition and number of species are observed in both collections. (4) A study of changes in relative abundance in bovid tribes indicates that similar patterns of variation through time are observed in both samples. This is considered to be evidence for the prevalence of generally similar habitats (and habitat change through time) in the north and south of the Shungura area. (5) However, habitat differences may have occurred locally, as inferred by differences in taxonomic abundances at the species level. For example, the bovid Menelikia lyrocera was more common in the southern parts of the Shungura exposures, while Kobus sigmoidalis was more common in the north. (6) Finally, the present study underscores the importance of the quality of data in unraveling past environments and patterns of faunal changes through time. Well-controlled and standardized collecting methods and systematic documentation procedures are critical for future fieldwork activities. This will improve the quality of our data, facilitate comparisons across regions, and lead to more robust hypotheses.},

	abstract = {The uneven distribution of species richness is a fundamental and unexplained pattern of vertebrate biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for {\textgreater}85\% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced “living fossils.” In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.},

	abstract = {Evenness is considered as the measure of equality of abundances in a community. By comparing artifical abundance distributions the modified Hill's ratio (N$_{\textrm{2}}$-1)/(N$_{\textrm{1}}$-1) was found to be the most easily interpreted evenness measure. The modification (subtracting 1 from Hill's numbers) is important when species diversity is low. Often the species richness of the community is underestimated, and because of the sampling bias evenness indices not using species richness are recommendable. The most popular evenness index J′ seems to be a rather ambiguous measure, since it is for purely mathematical reasons positively correlated with species richness. The ambiguity arises from the logarithmic relation of Shannon's entropy H′ to species richness. Hill's numbers with species as units are less ambiguous than diversity measures in general. After all, it is emphasized that there is no single way to measure evenness, and because of the looseness of the concept we have to be cautious in its application. /// Выровненность рассматривается как мера равновесия обилия в сообществе. Путем сравнения искусственного распределения обилия модифицированное отношение Хилла ( N$_{\textrm{2}}$- I)/( N$_{\textrm{1}}$- I) рассматривается как наиболее легко интерпретируемое измерение выровненности. Модификация (вычитаемая I из числа Хилла) имеет значение, если разнообразие видов низкое. Часто видовое разнообразие в сообществе недооценивается и, в результате ошибки выборки, рекомендуются индекоы выровенности, не учитывающиевидовое разнообразие. Наиболее популярный индекс выровненности у́ представляет скорее сомнительную величину. т.к. он по чисто математическим причинам коррелирует с разнообразием видов. Неясность возникает из логаяифмического отношения энтропии Шэннона Н́к видовому разнообразию. Числа Хилла, где вид использован в качестве единицы, менее сомнительны, если разнообразие оценивается в целом. В заключение подчеркивается, что это - не единственный способ оценки выровненности и вследствие слабости этой концепции мы должны быть осторожны в ее использовании.},

	abstract = {When is the baseline for Anthropocene? The first indications of human impact on earth closely relate to early human behavior and use of resources. First agricultural societies modified the landscape with the aim of generating their own resources to satisfy the needs of an increasing population. This new system was the result of years of learning and continuous interaction with landscape. Hunter-gatherer societies had shown a vast knowledge of their surrounding environment, which allowed them to exploit and optimize the available resources. But, had these societies the capacity to modify the landscape in such a way that can be traced up until today? How far back in time can we go to find the first evidence of human impact on earth? In this paper, we will try to analyze early human behavior and the possible impact of their activities on the landscape. We will use the paleoanthropological site of Olduvai Gorge (northern Tanzania) as a case study to suggest that the baseline for Anthropocene, taking the term as human impact on earth through cognitive-behavioral strategies, can be moved back to the time when early hominins visited Olduvai. Olduvai Gorge is perfectly suited for this study since the latest scientific research and publications have yielded a detailed knowledge of the vegetation, the landscape, and of the wildlife that lived in the area.},

	abstract = {The OH 36 ulna derives from Upper Bed II in the Olduvai Gorge, and is dated to circa 1.1–1.2 Myr. Multivariate analyses incorporating data from samples of modern humans, common and pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and two other early hominin ulnae, Omo L40-19 and KNM-BK 66, suggest that OH 36 belonged to an individual with powerful forearms consistent with a locomotor repertoire that included arboreal locomotion. However, there is no compelling evidence that it made regular use of its forelimbs as supports when travelling on the ground. When compared with levels of intra- and intertaxon size and shape variation in the comparative sample (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas), the differences between OH 36, KNM-BK 66, and Omo L40-19 are compatible with OH 36 differing from the other two fossil hominin ulnae to the extent that modern humans differ from modern great apes. KNM-BK 66 and Omo L40-19 differ from each other in overall size and shape only to the degree that would be expected within any of the individual modern comparative samples. Based on these analyses, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that OH 36 and Omo L40-19 belong to the same species of fossil hominin, or to two species that shared a similar forelimb locomotor repertoire. We suggest that OH 36 has the greater claim to be assigned to Paranthropus boisei, and we recommend that for the time being the latter be referred to the tribe Hominini gen. et sp. indet. The surprising result of these analyses is the overall size and shape similarity between Omo L40-19 and KNM-BK 66, two fossils that are separated in time by more than 1.5 million years, and which have traditionally been assumed to represent hominin species with quite different locomotor patterns.

	abstract = {A central question in ecology is to understand the ecological processes that shape community structure. Niche-based theories have emphasized the important role played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these insights have been derived using MacArthur’s consumer resource model (MCRM) or its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small ecosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights derived from small ecosystems many not scale up to large ecosystems with many resources and species because large systems with many interacting components often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from analyzing smaller systems. To address these shortcomings, we develop a statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when both the number of species and the number of resources is large. Unlike previous work in this limit, our theory addresses resource dynamics and resource depletion and demonstrates that species generically and consistently perturb their environments and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity approach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting for the effect of collective phenomena on species invasion and ecological stability. Our theory suggests that such phenomena are a generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account when analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the important role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in furthering our understanding of ecology.},

	abstract = {Occasional excavation of in situ and ex situ deposits at the formerly mined Gondolin paleocave system has yielded large and diverse samples of Plio-Pleistocene faunas, including isolated hominin and non-hominin primate remains. In 2003, new excavations into naturally decalcified, in situ sediments near the GD 1 datum point near the northwest corner of the cave system were undertaken. This paper describes the recovered faunal remains, taphonomy of the assemblage, and the geological and paleomagnetic context of the GD 1 deposits. The deposits represent a series of inter-stratified speleothem, in-washed sediments and talus deposits we suggest date to a time period prior to, and just after, the Olduvai normal-polarity event at around 1.7–1.8Ma. Surface sediments and clasts were introduced into the cave by rain water runoff entering a vertically-oriented entrance that had formed along a rift in the area of GD 1. The faunal assemblage consists primarily of fragmentary diaphyseal fragments and isolated teeth. Taxonomically, the small collection of specifically identifiable bovid and equid fossils is generally consistent with remains previously excavated from in situ deposits in the Gondolin paleocave system (GD 2) and dated to around 1.8Ma; however, the depositional histories of these two assemblages from Gondolin are remarkably different. The preservation and relative proportions of recovered skeletal elements at GD 1 is consistent with these materials having been initially accumulated outside the karstic system near the vertical cave entrance, and then later hydrologically sorted and deposited inside the cave. The sporadic to continuous water flow into the northwest corner of the cave system during the Pleistocene gradually decalcified the excavated fossilbearing breccias and further modified the composition and spatial distribution of the fossil assemblage by introducing potentially younger deposits and skeletal materials. This study highlights the variation in taphonomic processes that can occur within a single cave system, and the complex pre- and postdepositional geological and hydrological processes that can influence the taphonomic history of South African Plio-Pleistocene karstic fossil assemblages.},

Monotonically increasing curves have recently been dismissed on both empirical and theoretical grounds, while unimodal (@'hump-shaped@') curves have been supported. Unimodal curves have been attributed to increased competitive exclusion, usually as the result of decreased heterogeneity in limiting resources at high productivities. This article argues that: (1) there are many viable mechanisms that can produce monotonic curves in the presence of competition; (2) there is little empirical support for any of the major variants of the hypothesis that productivity decreases heterogeneity, which increases competitive exclusion; and (3) there are alternative reasons for unimodal curves, some or all of which are consistent with previously observed productivity-diversity relationships. Additional theoretical and empirical work is required to understand what relationships are follow from different mechanisms of competition, and what relationships are most frequently observed under different observational protocols.},

Specifically, we measured the effects of diversity in sex (sexual monocultures vs. male and female genotypes together) and growth rate (growth rate monocultures vs. fast- and slow-growing genotypes together) on growth of the shrub Baccharis salicifolia and on above- and belowground consumers associated with this plant. We compared effects on associate abundance (\# associates per plant) vs. density (\# associates per kg plant biomass) to elucidate the mechanisms underlying diversity effects; effects on abundance but not density suggest diversity effects are mediated by resource abundance (i.e. plant biomass) alone, whereas effects on density suggest diversity effects are mediated by plant-based heterogeneity or quality. Sexual diversity increased root growth but reduced the density (but not abundance) of the dietary generalist aphid Aphis gossypii and its associated aphid-tending ants, suggesting sex mixtures were of lower quality to this herbivore (e.g. via reduced plant quality), and that this effect indirectly influenced ants. Sexual diversity had no effect on the abundance or density of parasitoids attacking A. gossypii, the dietary specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai, or mycorrhizae. In contrast, growth rate diversity did not influence plant growth or any associates except for the dietary specialist aphid U. macolai, which increased in both abundance and density at high diversity, suggesting growth rate mixtures were of higher quality to this herbivore. These results highlight that plant associational and diversity effects on consumers are contingent upon the source of plant trait variation, and that the nature of such dynamics may vary both within and among trophic levels.},

The data set is carefully stratified to control environmental heterogeneity. The shape and distribution of species response curves are then examined along a temperature gradient using 750 sites. The conclusions are: (1) Bell shaped response curves to environmental gradients are not universal (2) Positive-skewed curves are characteristic of major canopy species in eucalypt forest in southern New South Wales (3) Species richness increases with temperature along the gradient (4) Tests of other propositions regarding species modes and ranges are confounded by the change in species richness along the gradients (5) More rigorous statistical analysis and analyses on other vegetation types are needed.},

In the face of uncertainty about evolutionary relationships, which phylogeny should one use? Here we provide a new resource for comparative studies of primates that enables users to run comparative analyses on multiple primate phylogenies Importantly, the 10,000 trees that we provide are not random, but instead use recent systematic methods to create a plausible set of topologies that reflect our certainty about some nodes on the tree and uncertainty about other nodes, given the dataset. The trees also reflect uncertainty about branch lengths.},

	abstract = {A literature-based compilation of phylogenetic relationships and biometric measurements of 342 Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal species suggests that the group shows a net increase in size through the Cenozoic, thus appearing to follow Cope's Rule of phyletic size increase. However, when the data are corrected for size-related biases, they do not support the hypothesis that this apparent trend is driven by an organismal adaptive advantage of larger size.When the planktonic foraminifera return to their “primitive” globigerine morphology during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, there is no indication of size-dependent origination or extinction; however, when the extinction signal is decomposed into pseudoextinctions and true lineage terminations, a differential pulse of pseudoextinction is observed among the smaller forms. This observation suggests that smaller bodied species, rather than surviving stressful times with static morphologies, may evolve their way through times of crisis and go on to found lineages which, by virtue of their initial small size, are stochastically likely to increase in mean size during subsequent diversification. Thus, one general explanation for Cope's Rule might be that smaller bodied species are more adaptively responsive due to their tendency to have shorter generation times. During times of stress, this adaptive responsiveness may give them an advantage that is correlated with, but causally unrelated to, their size.},

This period, which I call the Ongoing Synthesis, began in 1963 and continues at the present time. I use analysis of citations, conduct, and content to compare the Ongoing Synthesis to widely recognized periods of synthesis in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. To compare content, I focus on phenotypic evolution and compare current efforts with George Gaylord Simpson’s struggle to understand evolution in deep geological time. The essence of current effort is captured by the question, What is the best model for phenotypic evolution? Although many investigators are actively engaged in answering this question, I single out two examples of my own collaborative work for emphasis here. These two studies share three important characteristics: diagnosis of evolutionary pattern using massive data sets, validation of model parameter values using compilations of estimates (e.g., heritability, stabilizing selection, distance to an intermediate optimum), and identification of evolutionary process using alternative models of stochastic evolution. Our primary findings (discovery of the blunderbuss pattern and the result that rare bursts of evolution carry lineages out of established adaptive zones) compare favorably with important insights from the Modern Synthesis.},

Here, we present phylogenetic findings based on analyses of 67 complete mammalian mitochondrial (mt) genomes. The analyses, irrespective of whether they were performed at the amino acid (aa) level or on nucleotides (nt) of first and second codon positions, placed Erinaceomorpha (hedgehogs and their kin) as the sister group of remaining eutherians. Thus, the analyses separated Erinaceomorpha from other traditional lipotyphlans (e.g., tenrecs, moles, and shrews), making traditional Lipotyphla polyphyletic. Both the aa and nt data sets identified the two order-rich eutherian clades, the Cetferungulata (comprising Pholidota, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Cetacea) and the African clade (Tenrecomorpha, Macroscelidea, Tubulidentata, Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, and Sirenia). The study corroborated recent findings that have identified a sister-group relationship between Anthropoidea and Dermoptera (flying lemurs), thereby making our own order, Primates, a paraphyletic assembly. Molecular estimates using paleontologically well-established calibration points, placed the origin of most eutherian orders in Cretaceous times, 70–100 million years before present (MYBP). The same estimates place all primate divergences much earlier than traditionally believed. For example, the divergence between \textit{Homo} and \textit{Pan} is estimated to have taken place \&\#8776;10 MYBP, a dating consistent with recent findings in primate paleontology.},

	abstract = {Molecular analyses of the relationships of placental mammals have shown a progressive congruence between mitogenomic and nuclear phylogenies. Some inconsistencies have nevertheless persisted, notably with respect to basal divergences. The current study has aimed to extend the representation of groups, whose position in the placental tree has been difficult to establish in mitogenomic studies. Both ML (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian analyses identified four basal monophyletic groups, Afroplacentalia (=Afrotheria: Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, Sirenia, Tenrecidea, Tubulidentata, Macroscelidea, Chrysochloridea), Xenarthra, Archontoglires (Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Lagomorpha, Rodentia) and Laurasiaplacentalia (Lipotyphla, Chiroptera, Pholidota, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, Cetacea). All analyses joined Archontoglires and Laurasiaplacentalia on a common branch (Boreoplacentalia), but the relationship between Afroplacentalia, Xenarthra and Boreoplacentalia was not conclusively resolved. The phylogenomic hypothesis with a sister group relationship between Notoplacentalia (Afroplacentalia/Xenarthra) and Boreoplacentalia served as the basis for estimating the times of placental divergences using paleontologically well-supported mammalian calibration points. These estimates placed the basal placental divergence between Boreoplacentalia and Notoplacentalia at ≈102 MYA (million years ago). The current estimates of ordinal placental divergences are congruent with recent estimates based on nuclear data, but inconsistent with paleontological notions that have placed the origin of essentially all placental orders within an interval of 5–10 MY in the early Tertiary. Among less deep divergences the estimates placed the split between Gorilla and Pan/Homo at ≈11.5 MYA and that between Pan and Homo at ≈8 MYA. As a consequence of these estimates, which are in accord with recent progress in primate paleontology, the earliest divergences among recent humans become placed ≈270,000 years ago, i.e. ≈100,000 years earlier than the traditional age of “Mitochondrial Eve”. Comparison between the two new mt genomes of Hylomys suillus (short-tailed gymnure) patently demonstrates the inconsistency that may exist between taxonomic designations and molecular difference, as the distance between these two supposedly conspecific genomes exceeds that of the three elephantid genera Elephas, Mammuthus and Loxodonta. In accordance with the progressive use of the term Placentalia for extant orders and extinct taxa falling within this group we forward new proposals for the names of some superordinal clades of placental mammals.},

	abstract = {Increasing concern over the implications of climate change for biodiversity has led to the use of species–climate envelope models to project species extinction risk under climate-change scenarios. However, recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model predictions and there remains a pressing need to validate models and to reduce uncertainties. Model validation is problematic as predictions are made for events that have not yet occurred. Resubstituition and data partitioning of present-day data sets are, therefore, commonly used to test the predictive performance of models. However, these approaches suffer from the problems of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the calibration and validation sets. Using observed distribution shifts among 116 British breeding-bird species over the past ∼20 years, we are able to provide a first independent validation of four envelope modelling techniques under climate change. Results showed good to fair predictive performance on independent validation, although rules used to assess model performance are difficult to interpret in a decision-planning context. We also showed that measures of performance on nonindependent data provided optimistic estimates of models' predictive ability on independent data. Artificial neural networks and generalized additive models provided generally more accurate predictions of species range shifts than generalized linear models or classification tree analysis. Data for independent model validation and replication of this study are rare and we argue that perfect validation may not in fact be conceptually possible. We also note that usefulness of models is contingent on both the questions being asked and the techniques used. Implementations of species–climate envelope models for testing hypotheses and predicting future events may prove wrong, while being potentially useful if put into appropriate context.},

Human-induced edge effects further increase the environmental heterogeneity in these forests. The simultaneous effects of natural and human-induced gradients on the functional diversity of plant leaf traits are poorly understood. In a tropical montane forest in Bolivia, we studied environmental gradients associated with elevation (from 1900 m to 2500 m asl), topography (ridge and gorge), and edge effects (forest edge vs. forest interior), and their relationship with leaf traits and resource-use strategies. First, we investigated associations of environmental conditions (soil properties and microclimate) with six leaf traits, measured on 119 woody plant species. Second, we evaluated changes in functional composition with community-weighted means and functional structure with multidimensional functional diversity indices (FRic, FEve and FDiv). We found significant associations between leaf traits and soil properties in accordance with the trade-off between acquisition and conservation of resources. Functional composition of leaf traits shifted from the dominance of acquisitive species in habitats at low altitudes, gorges, and forest interior to the dominance of conservative species in habitats at high altitudes, ridges, and forest edges. Functional structure was only weakly associated with the environmental gradients. Natural and human-induced environmental gradients, especially soil properties, are important for driving leaf traits and resource-use strategies of woody plants. Nevertheless, weak associations between functional structure and environmental gradients suggest a high redundancy of functional leaf traits in this tropical montane forest.},

Fossils were collected in a tank deposit,a singular type of Quaternary vertebrate-bearing deposit of South America. In this work, a detailed taphonomic study of the tank assemblage of CPS is presented. This analysis also provides taphonomic and paleoecological data obtained through the application of common multivariate techniques and provides estimates of time- and spatial resolution for tank deposits. The results show that, although the CPS assemblage has experienced an array of taphonomic processes, the long-distance transport was the main process controlling the taphonomic pathway of the thanatocoenosis during the biostratinomic phase, and was responsible for the co-occurrence of other processes, such as abrasion, fragmentation and bioclastic sorting. The origin of the taphonomic modes of vertebrates in the tank deposit of CPS may have been controlled by three major taphonomic phenomena: (i) a taphonomic bias towards the large-bodied size; (ii) long time span of transportation towards the final burial environment; and (iii) some degree of reworking. Furthermore, the analysis of these taphonomic modes supports a previous hypothesis: although taphonomic biases affect the origin of tank assemblages, paleoecological patterns can be preserved with considerable fidelity. The time resolution in tank accumulations is of the order of 10- 3 to 104 years and their spatial resolution seems to be from local to regional.},

	abstract = {Small mammal bone assemblages from the scats of three families of mammalian carnivores are described here as a means of assessing paleontological bone assemblages. These are the Viverridae, Canidae, and Mustelidae. Marking behavior by the carnivores or their use of latrine areas can produce concentrations of bone comparable with those produced from owl pellets, but the nature of the bone assemblages is very different. Skeletal element preservation has a characteristic pattern related to the relative strength of the individual elements, so that the strongest elements are the ones that best survive the physical abrasion of the predator's teeth. Bone breakage is greatest in canids and least in some viverrids. Digestion of the bone occurs to a certain extent with all carnivores, with moderate rounding but little corrosion of either bones or teeth in viverrid-derived bone assemblages, very great rounding and severe corrosion of bone and tooth enamel (but little corrosion of tooth dentine) in canids, and moderate rounding and slight to moderate corrosion of bone and tooth dentine (but less of enamel) in mustelid-derived bone assemblages. Tooth marks are generally rare except in canid-derived bone assemblages. These patterns may enable the identification of predators responsible for the accumulation of fossil predator assemblages, and a consideration of the hunting and other behavior of that type of predator then permit the identification of possible biases in the fossil fauna. In the viverrids, for instance, the mongoose selected for large prey size and against cranial elements, while the genet took all prey sizes available to it and all body parts. Larger canids such as foxes and coyotes took both large and small species, but proportionally more of the most common prey species were present. Skulls were underrep-resented. The small canid, the bat-eared fox, selected for the smallest prey species available to it but took all body parts. Mustelids took all sizes of prey, although not necessarily in proportion to their abundance in the habitat, and large species were underrepresented. If the predator type is known, therefore, for a fossil assemblage, these biases can be taken into account in assessing the paleoecological significance of the fauna. An example from the Olduvai Pleistocene deposits is given.},

	abstract = {* 1We investigated the effects of changes in taxonomic resolution on analyses of patterns of multivariate variation at different spatial scales for the highly diverse fauna inhabiting holdfasts of the kelp Ecklonia radiata.
* 2Multivariate analyses were performed using several transformations to examine differences in spatial patterns of variation from metres up to hundreds of kilometres for composition vs. relative abundance in assemblages.
* 3The greatest variability in assemblages occurred at the smallest spatial scale, from plant to plant, pointing to the existence of important small-scale processes. The proportional amount of variation at the smallest spatial scale decreased with decreasing taxonomic resolution (i.e. from species through to phyla). For composition, the next-greatest source of variation was at the largest spatial scale (hundreds of kilometres), while for relative abundance, the next-greatest source of variation was at the level of sites (hundreds of metres to kilometres).
* 4For abundance data, location-level variation became less important and site-level variation became more important with decreasing taxonomic resolution, while for compositional data, the opposite pattern occurred. This suggests that variation in the presence of species or taxa at a particular location along the coast is driven by large-scale processes, while variation in relative abundances within locations is driven by medium-scale processes.
* 5The lack of significant variation in the proportional abundances of phyla at large spatial scales suggests that some consistency of pattern may emerge at larger scales (spatial and/or taxonomic), even in the presence of high small-scale variability. These findings strengthen the idea that substantial local variation need not preclude the existence of broad-scale organization in ecological patterns and biodiversity.},

Three extrapolations have been made on the basis of the uniquely rich megaflora/insect coassemblages from 100 taphocoenoses: insect species-335 observed, 7740 preserved; vegetative species-206 observed, 667 preserved; gymnosperm ovulate orders-16 observed, 84 preserved. The reliability of the results varies according to the abundance and observed diversity of the taxa. These results, with further estimations in a companion paper of existed diversity (regional, continental and global), hint at Late Triassic floral and faunal richness akin to today. This conflicts with the traditionally held model of an increasing cone of biodiversity through time and suggests a phase of explosive evolution in the Triassic hitherto unsuspected. Application of the GIGP to other well-documented collections from other periods might reveal a pattern of diversity trends offering fundamentally new insights into the evolving terrestrial biosphere.},

	abstract = {I investigate two aspects of source–sink theory that have hitherto received little attention: density-dependent dispersal and the cost of dispersal to sources. The cost arises because emigration reduces the per capita growth rate of sources, thus predisposing them to extinction. I show that source–sink persistence depends critically on the interplay between these two factors. When the emigration rate increases with abundance at an accelerating rate, dispersal costs to sources is the lowest and risk of source–sink extinction the least. When the emigration rate increases with abundance at a decelerating rate, dispersal costs to sources is the highest and the risk of source–sink extinction the greatest. Density-independent emigration has an intermediate effect. Thus, density-dependent dispersal per se does not increase or decrease source–sink persistence relative to density-independent dispersal. The exact mode of dispersal is crucial. A key point to appreciate is that these effects of dispersal on source–sink extinction arise from the temporal density-dependence that dispersal induces in the per capita growth rates of source and sink populations. Temporal density-dependence due to dispersal is beneficial at low abundances because it rescues sinks from extinction, and detrimental at high abundances because it drives otherwise viable sources to extinction. These results are robust to the nature of population dynamics in the sink, whether exponential or logistic. They provide a means of assessing the relative costs and benefits of preserving sink habitats given three biological parameters.},

	abstract = {Much is known about the evolution of dispersal when species interact with their resources or natural enemies, but very little is known about dispersal evolution when species interact with both resources and natural enemies. Here I investigate how the dispersal of an intermediate consumer evolves in response to its interactions with a basal resource and top predator. I find that dispersal evolution is possible even when the consumer species is not directly affected by environmental variability, but rather experiences the consequences that such variability has on its resource and predator. Spatial variation in the consumer's fitness is driven by spatial heterogeneity in resource productivity, which determines whether a predator can colonize a resource-consumer community. Temporal variation in the consumer's fitness is driven by random disturbances that cause periodic local extinctions of the predator, followed by recolonizations that lead to transient fluctuations in consumer abundance. When spatial variation in resource productivity is low and the predator can colonize all patches in the landscape, there is no spatial variation in consumer fitness but temporal variation in fitness favors the evolution of a dispersal monomorphism. When spatial variation in resource productivity is high and the predator cannot colonize many patches in the landscape, spatial variation in fitness selects against dispersal. In this case, temporal variation can promote the evolution of a dispersal polymorphism with sedentary and mobile phenotypes, but only for certain types of tri-trophic interactions. This finding underscores the importance of indirect interactions in shaping the evolution of dispersal. While the ecological community can provide a strong selective environment for the evolution of dispersal, the nature of interactions between trophic levels can also impose constraints on evolution.},

	abstract = {Few methods exist that put a posterior probability on the hypothesis that a thing is gone forever given its sighting history. A recently proposed Bayesian method is highly accurate but aggressive, generating many near-zero or near-one probabilities of extinction. Here I explore a Bayesian method called the agnostic equation that makes radically different assumptions and is much more conservative. The method assumes that the overall prior probability of extinction is 50\% and that slices of the prior are exponentially distributed across the time series. The conditional probability of the data given survival is based on a simple, long-known combinatorial expression that captures the chance all presences would fall at random before or within the last sighting’s interval (L) given that they could fall anywhere. The same equation is used to compute the conditional probability given extinction at the start of each interval i, that is, the chance that all sightings would fall before or within L given that none could equal or postdate i. The conditional probability is zero for all hypothesized extinction intervals through L. Bayes’s theorem is then used to compute the posterior extinction probability. It is noted that recycling the mean posterior for a population as a prior improves the method’s accuracy. The agnostic equation differs from an earlier, related one, because it explicitly includes a term to represent the hypothesis of survival, and it therefore does not assume that the species has necessarily gone extinct within the sampling window. Simulations demonstrate that the posterior extinction probabilities are highly accurate when considered as a suite but individually indecisive, rarely approaching one. This property is advantageous whenever inferring extinction would have dangerous consequences. The agnostic method is therefore advocated in cases where conservative estimates are desired.},

We show that for dynamical models of realistically structured ecological networks in which pair-wise consumer-resource interactions allometrically scale to the ¾ power—as suggested by metabolic theory—the effect of losing one species on another can be predicted well by simple functions of variables easily observed in nature. By systematically removing individual species from 600 networks ranging from 10–30 species, we analyzed how the strength of 254,032 possible pair-wise species interactions depended on 90 stochastically varied species, link, and network attributes. We found that the interaction strength between a pair of species is predicted well by simple functions of the two species' biomasses and the body mass of the species removed. On average, prediction accuracy increases with network size, suggesting that greater web complexity simplifies predicting interaction strengths. Applied to field data, our model successfully predicts interactions dominated by trophic effects and illuminates the sign and magnitude of important nontrophic interactions.},

	abstract = {A key question in palaeontology is whether the fossil record taken at face value is adequate to represent true patterns of diversity through time. Some methods of assessing data quality have depended on the commonly observed covariation of palaeodiversity and fossiliferous formation counts through time, based on the assumption that the count of formations containing fossils, to a greater or lesser extent, drives diversity; but what if diversity drives formations? Close study of two fossil records, early tetrapods (Devonian–Jurassic) and dinosaurs, shows how the relationship between new taxa and new fossiliferous formations varies through research time. Initially, each new find represents a new fossiliferous formation and discovery follows the ‘bonanza’ model (fossils drive formations). In unexplored parts of the world, new taxa are identified frequently in new regions/formations. Only after time, in well-explored continents such as Europe and North America, does collecting style switch to a mix of exploration for new formations and re-sampling of known fossiliferous formations. Data are most striking for dinosaurs, where the Triassic–Jurassic record largely comprises finds from Europe and North America, where new formation discoveries reached their half-life in 1914. This contrasts with the Cretaceous, which is dominated by rapidly rising discoveries from regions outside Europe and North America and the formation half-life for these ‘new’ lands is 1986, showing that 50\% of new Cretaceous dinosaur-bearing formations were identified only in the past 30 years. The relationship between dinosaur-bearing formations and palaeodiversity then combines three signals in variable amounts, reflecting the original diversity (relative abundances of particular taxa in different formations), redundancy (new fossiliferous formations accruing because of new fossil finds) and sampling (intensity of exploration for new fossiliferous formations, and of search within already-sampled formations). For fossil vertebrates at least, formation counts of various kinds are poor predictors of sampling, missing, for example, the bonanza samples of Lagerstätten such as the Yixian Formation in China: thousands of specimens, dozens of species, but counted as one formation. These observations suggest that formation count cannot be regarded as an unbiased metric of sampling.},

	abstract = {Competitive replacement has probably played a minor role in the history of tetrapods. In an assessment of the origins of 840 families of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, fewer than 26\%, and probably fewer than 13\%, were identified as candidate competitive replacements (CCR's). This is the pool of families that shared their geographic area of origination and their broadscale adaptations with a pre-existing family, and is thus a maximum measure of families that might have competitively displaced another. Most tetrapod families arose by expansion of the ecospace and geographic areas previously occupied by other members of the clade Tetrapoda. The numbers of CCRS through time are roughly in proportion to numbers of originations, but particular peaks in CCRS occurred after mass extinctions. Pure expansions, with no possibility of competitive replacement, were prevalent during the Late Palaeozoic (radiation of early amphibian and reptile groups, and broadening of habitats occupied and diets) and during the mid Cretaceous (radiations of frogs, turtles, lizards, snakes, and birds).},

This article focuses on discussion of the conditional frequentist approach to testing, which is argued to provide the basis for a methodological unification of the approaches of Fisher, Jeffreys and Neyman. The idea is to follow Fisher in using p-values to define the "strength of evidence" in data and to follow his approach of conditioning on strength of evidence; then follow Neyman by computing Type I and Type II error probabilities, but do so conditional on the strength of evidence in the data. The resulting conditional frequentist error probabilities equal the objective posterior probabilities of the hypotheses advocated by Jeffreys.},

Invasion may increase with richness if large species pools represent weaker environmental filters. Measuring species pool size and the proportion realised locally (completeness) may clarify diversity-invasion relationships by separating environmental and biotic effects, especially if species’ life-history stage and origin are accounted for. To test these relationships, we added seeds and transplants of 15 native and alien species into 29 grasslands. Species pool size and completeness explained more variation in invasion than richness alone. Although results varied between native and alien species, seed establishment and biotic resistance to transplants increased with species pool size, whereas transplant growth and biotic resistance to seeds increased with completeness. Consequently, species pools and completeness represent multiple independent processes affecting invasion; accounting for these processes improves our understanding of invasion.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

When they discuss them at all, ecologists often disagree about the relative importance of different aspects of the science's original and still important issues. It may be that the sum of ecological science is not open to universal statements because of the wide range of organizational, spatial, and temporal phenomena, as well as the sheer number of possible interactions. We believe, however, that the search for general principles has been inadequate to establish the extent to which generalities are possible. We suggest that ecologists may need to reconsider how we view our science.

	abstract = {Lévy walks (LW) are superdiffusive and scale-free random walks that have recently emerged as a new conceptual tool for modeling animal search paths. They have been claimed to be more efficient than the "classical" random walks, and they also seem able to account for the actual search patterns of various species. This suggests that many animals may move using a LW process. LW patterns look like the actual search patterns displayed by animals foraging in a patchy environment, where extensive and intensive searching modes alternate, and which can be generated by a mixture of classical random walks. In this context, even elementary composite Brownian walks are more efficient than LW but may be confounded with them because they present apparent move-length-heavy tail distributions and superdiffusivity. The move-length "survival" distribution (i.e., the cumulative number of moves greater than any given threshold) appears to be a better means to highlight a LW pattern. Even once such a pattern has been clearly identified, it remains to determine how it was actually generated, because a LW pattern is not necessarily produced by a LW process but may emerge from the way the animal interacted with the environment structure through more classical movement processes. In any case, emergent movement patterns should not be confused with the processes that gave rise to them.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462088},
	abstract = {The main methodological problem of comparative biology is to distinguish between effects attributable to ancestry and those attributable to function. The nested analysis of variance addresses this problem by partitioning variance and covariance between taxonomic levels. The estimation of variance components and the derived intraclass correlation coefficient can be used to describe the overall increase in variation through time and the relation between variances at different taxonomic levels. Applying this procedure to data about the body mass of eutherian mammals showed a steep increase in variance associated with the adaptive radiation of the group in early Tertiary times, with much lower rates of increase thereafter; chromosome number showed a similar but shallower increase, implying that chromosome number varies more between taxa at lower levels of classification than does body mass. The variance of species within genera increased with the geologic age of the genus, permitting a quantitative description of the rate of evolutionary divergence. A straightforward extension of the technique yields estimates of taxonomic components of covariance and the associated interclass correlation coefficients. It is argued that covariance between taxa is attributable to ancestry and covariance within taxa to function, and that adaptive hypotheses should be tested by the within-taxon correlation. This technique is illustrated by analyzing the covariance of litter mass with gestation period, independent of body mass, among eutherians. This reveals substantial correlation within species, attributed to function, and between suborders and orders, where it was attributed to ancestry, with little or no correlation at intermediate taxonomic levels. The components of variance and covariance can be used to describe how the correlation changes through time, in this case declining continuously from the time of divergence of suborders onward. Two sources of phylogenetic constraint are identified: the taxonomic components of covariance themselves, which may reflect the past operation of selection; and differences among correlation or regression coefficients among taxa at a given level of classification, representing an interaction between phylogeny and function, which may arise when a third variable alters the pattern of selection.},

	abstract = {Comparative study of fossil-bearing fluvi' deposits in the Eocene Willwood Formation of northern Wyoming and the Miocene Chinji Formation of northern Pakistan indicate how tectonic and climatic processes operating at different scales controlled physical and chemical features of floodplain environments and affected preservation of the paleontological record.

The architecture of Willwood Fm. floodplain deposits represents a combination of avulsion-belt sediment packages and overbank sediments that formed alluvial ridges. The architecture of the Chinji Fm. floodplain deposits was controlled by widely distributed crevasse-splay deposition and floodplain topography. Similarities in individual paleosol-bounded overbank sequences from the two formations indicates that the internal structure of such deposits can be independent of channel belt proximity to areas of aggradation. Chinji Fm. paleosols have little vertical zonation and show no consistent pattern of lateral change in relation to major channels, while overbank paleosols in the Willwood Fm, exhibit considerable soil horizon development and a pattern of increasing maturity from alluvial ridge to distal floodplain. The “pedofacies model” of Bown and Kraus (1987) based on such lateral trends in the Willwood paleosols is not applicable to the Chinji Fm.

Plant and animal fossils are abundant in the Willwood overbank deposits, with vertebrate remains concentrated in paleosol A horizons. Plant remains are rare in the Chinji Fm. and vertebrate fossils occur primarily in channel fills rather than in paleosols. These differences relate to contrasting patterns of floodplain deposition and to levels of oxidation that controlled penecontemporaneous recycling of organic material, particularly in paleosols. Different large-scale climatic and tectonic controls on temperature and rainfall, water table fluctuations, and soil biota are proposed to account for the differences in organic preservation. Large and small-scale environmental processes also affected spatial and temporal resolution of the organic record, resulting in important differences in the paleoecological and evolutionary information that can be reconstructed from the two sequences.},

	abstract = {Interpretations of vertebrate paleoecology depend on knowledge of taphonomical processes which alter the composition of the preserved fossil assemblage from that of the original community. Study of the potential fossil record of a recent mammal community in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, shows the effects of some of these biasing processes and demonstrates how a bone assemblage on a modern land surface can be a source of past and present ecological information. In the bone assemblage, species presence or absence and relative abundance differ from recorded living species occurrences and population sizes: only 74\% of the extant species in the basin are identified in the bone sample, and carcass abundances vary significantly from known population sizes of the major herbivore species. Both biases appear to be strongly correlated to body size, and this results from greater destruction of bones of smaller animals within the weight range from about 1-1000 kg. This size-biasing against small species appears to be due primarily to the greater susceptibility of small bones to destruction by carnivore mastication, breakage through bioturbation (trampling), and physical and chemical processes of weathering. Size-biasing resulting from such primary processes can thus be inherited by buried bone assemblages whatever their final mode of deposition. The bone assemblage also provides information on the spatial distributions of the major herbivore species over six major habitats. Patterns of strong habitat specificity are accurately represented in the bone assemblage. However, the record for certain species is affected by their seasonal and diurnal habitat shifts so that their bone distributions do not match live census data. The Amboseli bone assemblage provides a modern analogue for taphonomical processes which may have affected fossil assemblages derived from paleo-land surfaces prior to fluvial transport. It also helps to define limits of resolution in interpreting paleoecological information from such fossil assemblages.},

	abstract = {This study uses stable isotope variation within individual Mio-Pliocene paleosols to investigate subkilometer-scale phytogeography of late Miocene vegetation change in southeast Asia between ca. 8.1 and 5 Ma, a time interval that coincides with dramatic global vegetation change. We examine trends through time in the distribution of low-latitude grasses (C4 plants) and forest (C3 plants) on Indo-Gangetic floodplains using carbon (δ13C) and oxygen isotopic (δ18O) values in buried soil carbonates in Siwalik Series sediments exposed in the Rohtas Anticline, north-central Pakistan. Revised, high-resolution magnetostratigraphy and a new 40Ar/39Ar date provide improved age control for the 2020 m Rohtas section. Carbon isotope results capture lateral variability of C3 versus C4 plants at five stratigraphic levels, R11 (8.0 Ma), R15 (6.74–6.78 Ma), R23 (5.78 Ma), R29 (4.8–4.9 Ma), and upper boundary tuff (UBT; 2.4 Ma), using detailed sampling of paleosols traceable laterally over hundreds of meters. Paleosols and the contained isotopic results can be assigned to three different depositional contexts within the fluvial sediments: channel fill, crevassesplay, and floodplain environments. δ13C results show that near the beginning (8.0 Ma) and after (4.0 Ma) the period of major ecological change, vegetation was homogeneously C3 or C4, respectively, regardless of paleo-landscape position. In the intervening period, there is a wide range of values overall, with C4 grasses first invading the drier portions of the system (floodplain surfaces) and C3 plants persisting in moister settings, such as topographically lower channel swales. Although abrupt on a geologic timescale, changes in abundance of C4 plants are modest (∼2\% per 100,000 yr) compared to rates of vegetation turnover in response to glacial and interglacial climate changes in the Quaternary. Earlier research documented a sharply defined C3 to C4 transition in Pakistan between 8.1 and 5.0 Ma, based on vertical sampling, but this higher-resolution study reveals a more gradual transition between 8.0 and 4.5 Ma in which C3 and C4 plants occupied different subenvironments of the Siwalik alluvial plain.
δ18O values as well as δ13C values of soil carbonate increase up section at Rohtas, similar to isotope trends in other paleosol records from the region. Spatially, however, there is no correlation between δ13C and δ18O values at most stratigraphic levels. This implies that the changes in soil hydrology brought about by the shift from forest to grassland (i.e., an increase in average soil evaporation) did not produce the shift through time in δ18O values. We interpret the trend toward heavier soil carbonate δ18O values as a response to changes in external climatic factors such as a net decrease in rainfall over the past 9 Ma.},

	abstract = {Avian skeletal remains occur in many fossil assemblages, and in spite of small sample sizes and incomplete preservation, they may be a source of valuable paleoecological information. In this paper, we examine the taphonomy of a modern avian bone assemblage and test the relationship between ecological data based on avifaunal skeletal remains and known ecological attributes of a living bird community. A total of 54 modern skeletal occurrences and a sample of 126 identifiable bones from Amboseli Park, Kenya, were analyzed for weathering features and skeletal part preservation in order to characterize preservation features and taphonomic biases. Avian remains, with the exception of ostrich, decay more rapidly than adult mammal bones and rarely reach advanced stages of weathering. Breakage and the percentage of anterior limb elements serve as indicators of taphonomic overprinting that may affect paleoecological signals. Using ecomorphic categories including body weight, diet, and habitat, we compared species in the bone assemblage with the living Amboseli avifauna. The documented bone sample is biased toward large body size, representation of open grassland habitats, and grazing or scavenging diets. In spite of this, multidimensional scaling analysis shows that the small faunal sample (16 out of 364 species) in the pre-fossil bone assemblage accurately represents general features of avian ecospace in Amboseli. This provides a measure of the potential fidelity of paleoecological reconstructions based on small samples of avian remains. In the Cenozoic, the utility of avian fossils is enhanced because bird ecomorphology is relatively well known and conservative through time, allowing back-extrapolations of habitat preferences, diet, etc. based on modern taxa.},

	abstract = {Taphonomy plays diverse roles in paleobiology. These include assessing sample quality relevant to ecologic, biogeographic, and evolutionary questions, diagnosing the roles of various taphonomic agents, processes and circumstances in generating the sedimentary and fossil records, and reconstructing the dynamics of organic recycling over time as a part of Earth history. Major advances over the past 15 years have occurred in understanding (1) the controls on preservation, especially the ecology and biogeochemistry of soft-tissue preservation, and the dominance of biological versus physical agents in the destruction of remains from all major taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates); (2) scales of spatial and temporal resolution, particularly the relatively minor role of out-of-habitat transport contrasted with the major effects of time-averaging; (3) quantitative compositional fidelity; that is, the degree to which different types of assemblages reflect the species composition and abundance of source faunas and floras; and (4) large-scale variations through time in preservational regimes (megabiases), caused by the evolution of new bodyplans and behavioral capabilities, and by broad-scale changes in climate, tectonics, and geochemistry of Earth surface systems. Paleobiological questions regarding major trends in biodiversity, major extinctions and recoveries, timing of cladogenesis and rates of evolution, and the role of environmental forcing in evolution all entail issues appropriate for taphonomic analysis, and a wide range of strategies are being developed to minimize the impact of sample incompleteness and bias. These include taphonomically robust metrics of paleontologic patterns, gap analysis, equalizing samples via rarefaction, inferences about preservation probability, isotaphonomic comparisons, taphonomic control taxa, and modeling of artificial fossil assemblages based on modern analogues. All of this work is yielding a more quantitative assessment of both the positive and negative aspects of paleobiological samples. Comparisons and syntheses of patterns across major groups and over a wider range of temporal and spatial scales present a challenging and exciting agenda for taphonomy in the coming decades.},

(Afar Locality) 333 hominin locality provides paleoenvironmental information at geographic scales of hundreds of meters to kilometers as well as insights regarding alluvial deposition and pedogenesis in the middle Denen Dora Member of the Hadar Formation. A.L. 333 is dated at ca. 3.2 Ma and has produced over 260 surface and excavated specimens of Australopithecus afarensis. It represents an unusual source of high-resolution information about the paleoenvironmental context of this hominin. The in situ hominin fossils are associated with the final stages of filling of a paleochannel and were buried prior to the formation of overlying paleosols. Preserved bedding structures in the fine-grained hominin-producing strata provide evidence that the abandoned channel continued to aggrade prior to the onset of sustained pedogenesis. Pedogenic carbonates associated with the hominin level thus postdate the death and burial of the hominins, possibly by centuries to millennia. The reconstructed paleodrainage of the DD-2 sandstone (DD-2s) is oriented south to north and consists of a trunk channel, {\textasciitilde}40 m wide and 3–5 m deep, connecting a tributary system south of A.L. 333 to a distributary system to the north, which likely ended on the deltaic plain associated with the basin's depocenter. The hominin concentration occurs in the upper part of the fill of the trunk channel. The burial of the hominin remains involved fine-grained deposition indicating low-energy, seasonal flood events, and there is no sedimentological evidence for a high-energy, catastrophic flood that could have caused the demise of the hominins.},

The goal of this chapter is to explore the common ground between these fields through taphonomy, the sub-field of paleontology that examines how organisms are preserved as fossils. From studies of recent bone assemblages, taphonomists have assembled information about diversity and abundance, animal behaviour, predator–prey interactions, habitat utilization, mortality (how and where animals die), and nutrient recycling. These studies were initiated to strengthen paleontological understanding of the information content and biases in the fossil record, but the methods and discoveries of taphonomic research in modern ecosystems are also of potential value to ecologists. Both paleontology and ecology would benefit from increased exchange of ideas and perspectives, and this chapter provides examples showing why such exchange is worth pursuing and offers suggestions to encourage future dialogue and collaboration.},

	abstract = {Taphonomy established itself in paleontology primarily as a subdiscipline of paleoecology, but it has evolved into a much broader study of the ways in which preservation affects the fossil record. The past decade has seen a change in emphasis from descriptive taphonomic studies of fossil assemblages to more experimental, process-oriented investigations of necrolysis, stratification, and diagenesis of organic remains in modern environments. These actualistic studies are increasing the sophistication of taphonomic analysis in the fossil record by sharpening the diagnosis of bias in paleontological data and by providing a baseline for quantitative modeling of preservational patterns. The analysis of bias is also expanding into the evaluation of temporal resolution in the fossil record (sample acuity, stratigraphic completeness), and taphonomic research is thus contributing to broad-scale problems in evolution, biogeography, and biostratigraphy. In addition, taphonomic studies are providing new insights into paleoenvironmental reconstruction and into the direct paleobiological significance of post mortem processes such as the behavior of scavengers and the role of dead hardparts in structuring benthic communities. One of taphonomy's most promising new frontiers is comparative analysis applied to different taxonomic groups within assemblages and across environments, tectonic settings, and climatic regimes. All of this currently active research is contributing to a better understanding of the fossil record as the result of a dynamic, evolving, integrated system of biological and sedimentological processes that have both limited and enhanced knowledge of Earth history.},

Commonness was quantified using occurrence frequency of the 450 most frequently occurring genera of these groups in the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). Durability was scored for each taxon on the basis of shell size, thickness, reinforcement (ribs, folds, spines), mineralogy, and microstructural organic content. Contrary to taphonomic expectation, common genera in the PBDB are as likely to be small, thin-shelled, and unreinforced as large, thick-shelled, ribbed, folded, or spiny. In fact, only six of the 30 tests we performed showed a statistically significant relationship between durability and occurrence frequency, and these six tests were equally divided in supporting or contradicting the taphonomic expectation. Thus, for the most commonly occurring genera in these three important groups, taphonomic effects are either neutral with respect to durability or compensated for by other factors (e.g., less durable taxa were more common in the original communities). These results suggest that biological information is retained in the occurrence frequency patterns of our target groups.},

Such residuals, which are treated as being asymptotically normally distributed, arise by assuming that the cell frequencies are Poisson random variables so that their mean and variance are the same. However, studies in the past reveal that this is not the case and that the cell frequencies are prone to overdispersion. There are a growing number of remedies that have been proposed in the statistics, and allied, literature. One such remedy, and the focus of this paper, is to stabilise the variance using the Freeman–Tukeytransformation. Therefore, the properties that stem from performing correspondence analysis will be examined by decomposing the Freeman–Tukey residuals of a two-way contingency table. The application of this strategy shall be made by studying one large, and sparse, set of archaeological data.},

	abstract = {We document variability in the gross energetic yield and skeletal distribution of long bone marrow in 27 East African ungulates, representing eight species of bovids, equids and suids. Body size explains much of the variability in marrow wet weights among and within bovid species, but locomotor adaptations and marrow cavity structure are also important, especially in explaining the lower absolute marrow yields of suid (warthog) and equid (zebra) long bones. When expressed in terms of actual kilocalorie content, variability in the absolute yield and skeletal distribution of marrow is increased among adults by fat-depletion attendant upon nutritional stress, and among subadults by incomplete fat deposition. Long bone marrow yields of sheep and caribou (Binford, Nunamiut Ethnoarchaeology, 1978; New York: Academic Press), upon which most economic analyses of zooarchaeological assemblages are based, are not representative of the variability seen in East African ungulates.

Application of individual bovid Kcal models to Bunn's (Journal of Human Evolution, 1986; 15, 673-690) data on long bone abundances at two Bed I archaeological sites from Olduvai Gorge suggests that hominids selectively broke those bones with higher energy yields from marrow. This application is also used to discuss problems in economic analyses of zooarchaeological assemblages, particularly the need to construct utility indices that are sensitive to the tremendous variability in economic anatomy, but not so specific as to go beyond the resolution of zooarchaeological data.},

	abstract = {A stochastic, hierarchical model for the evolution of the advanced hominid brain is developed. The fossil and geological data date the event to 1.6-1.8 million years ago. Palaeoclimatological evidence does not suggest that it coincided with significant ecological change. The cognitive capacities of "small" hominoid brains are reviewed in the context of pongid technology and carnivory and the evidence for hominid stone tool technology prior to the Plio/Pleistocene. Calibration information suggests that small-brained gracile australopithecines represented a successful long-term adaptation to their particular African ecozones. The evolution of the advanced hominid brain is, therefore, likely the result of ongoing stochastic genetic processes that keep the eukaryotic genome in a state of genetic flux without reference to the selection pressures generated by macroscopic biotic communities. Radiometric calibration of the fossil evidence viewed in conjunction with computer simulations of macroevolutionary events suggests that the time required for the appearance of the advanced hominid brain was short (in geological terms). The adaptive potential conferred upon the evolving Homo lineage was profound, and feedback effects that further promoted brain development were likely because of new dietary biases. This model is consistent with assumptions derived from both the neo-Darwinian modern synthesis and the punctuated-equilibria model. A speculative reconstruction of early hominid population structure describes the context in which either (a) a "fast gradualism" produced a macroevolutionary change or (b) a phenotype produced by a rapid burst of speciation was fine-tuned. To the extent that the model proposed is hierarchical, it is independent of the modern synthesis.},

	abstract = {The sequence in which nonhuman carnivores consumed the edible parts of 260 larger herbivore carcasses in the Serengeti region of Tanzania proceeds from (1) hindquarter flesh, to (2) ribcage and forequarter flesh, (3) head flesh, (4) hindlimb marrow, (5) forelimb marrow, and lastly, (6) head contents. Only minor deviations from the regional consumption sequence occur, which are based on energetic and mechanical factors related to differences in carcass size and age, and consumer type.

The results are used to model the archaeological signatures of scavenging and hunting. Assemblages accumulated by scavenging are expected to show a positive relationship between skeletal part representation and the frequencies by which the parts survive consumption by modern carnivores with edible tissues. Assemblages accumulated by hunting should show a negative relationship between the variables. Variations in the magnitude of the predicted relationships will be effected by carcass size and local degrees of competition for carcasses, but in a similar manner for scavenging and hunting.

The efficacy of carcass consumption sequences for distinguishing hunting from scavenging archaeologically is compared to the carcass disarticulation sequence used by Potts (1983), and bone survivorship data used by Binford (1984). A preliminary application of the consumption sequence model to the Klasies River Mouth fauna indicates that medium-sized (size 3) and large (size 4) bovids at Klasies were scavenged primarily. Smaller (size 1 and 2) bovids show a distinct pattern, one more consistent with hunting. These results are similar to Binford's (1984), but for reasons that are argued to have a firmer empirical basis.},

Unit flesh weights are provided for a sample of wild Thomson's gazelle, Grant's gazelle, impala and wildebeest. The data permit accurate estimates of the quantity of flesh consumed by modern carnivores and are useful for interpreting skeletal part profiles of archaeological bone assemblages. Despite relative constancy in the percentage of whole carcass flesh (about 50\%), there exist differences in the distribution of flesh between sexes (neck v. pelvic-lumbar regions) and among taxa (forelimb v. hindlimb), but apparently not among age classes.
Résumé
On a calculé des unités de poids de chair dans un échantillon composé de gazelles de Thomson et de Grant, d'impalas et de gnous sauvages. Ces données permettent l'estimation de viande consommée par les carnivores actuels et sont utiles pour interpréter les profils squelettiques des assemblages osseux archéologiques. En dépit d'une constance relative dans le pourcentage de chair de la carcasse (environ 50\%), il existe entre les sexes des différences dans la répartition de la chair (cou par rapport aux régions pelvique et lombaire) et entre les espèces (membres antérieurs par rapport aux membres postérieurs), mais apparemment pas entre les classes d'âge.},

	abstract = {The phylogenies of Andrews and Simons provided the descriptive framework within which the pacing of evolutionary change during the radiation of late Neogene hominoids was investigated. The analysis can be adequately encompassed within a scheme comprised of four rate classes. Rates of change between individual teeth are almost completely uncoupled. Rates of change in mandibular structure and in the few available long bone measurements are of the same order of magnitude as the rate indices that characterize tooth change and are highly correlated with such indices. Within the slow rate classes, the rate of evolutionary change is coupled to the degree of morphometric separation realized. With the moderate and rapid rate classes, no such relationship is revealed. Distantly related taxa are frequently grouped in the same rate class, an observation that suggests similarities in the capacity to respond to selective pressures of comparable intensity within many late Neogene hominoids. Evolutionary rates appear to be more rapid in pongid and hominid phyletic lines than in other hominoid lineages. The Simon's phylogeny meets a criterion of minimal morphological gaps better than does that of Andrews. Consideration of both elephant and hominoid rate data suggests that a pattern of change that exhibits a slowing down midway through the history of a lineage may be of general significance. Examples of very rapid change support one feature of the Punctuated Equilibria model and raise questions concerning the nature of the evidence for slow rates of morphometric progression.},

	abstract = {Instructors of introductory statistics classes tend to separate out abstract probability concepts because of the level of mathematics required to present them. The Law of Large Numbers, which explains why making repeated observations on a population is informative, seems especially vulnerable to this tendency. This is unfortunate because the Law validates students' intuitive understanding about why statistics works and reinforces the notion that abstract probability concepts have important, real-life consequences. Instead of presenting the Law in a mathematical fashion, we propose a graphical presentation designed to communicate and emphasize the Law's importance. Specifically, we illustrate the effect that the Law of Large Numbers has on a sequence of sample means by plotting a randomly generated sequence of sample means versus their sample size. Students can then observe (1) how the sample mean approaches the population mean as the sample size grows large, (2) the variability associated with that process, and (3) the implied mathematical result. The corresponding sequence of probability intervals for the sample mean can then be superimposed on the plot to show how the sample mean's variability is reduced as the sample size grows. Furthermore, the sequence of confidence intervals can also be superimposed on the plot to demonstrate that the concept of coverage probability applies only to the procedure for setting confidence intervals (which we refer to as a random probability interval) and not to the observed confidence interval itself.},

A dental mesowear analysis was applied to 117 specimens of bovids representing the four tribes present in the anthracotheriid unit localities: Hippotragini, Reduncini, Antilopini and Bovini. All these bovids fed on grasses, at least partially. Previous analyses and the present results indicate the presence of a mosaic-like environment containing various habitats from grasslands to woodlands in the surroundings of the Chadian lake basin. Indeed, our data support the availability of grass or grass-like plants and therefore open patches in the vicinity of the Chadian palaeo-lake shores.},

	abstract = {Mapping past vegetation dynamics from heterogeneous databases of fossil-pollen records must face the challenge of temporal uncertainty. The growing collection of densely sampled fossil-pollen records with accurate and precise chronologies allows us to develop new methods to assess and reduce this uncertainty. Here, we test our methods in the context of vegetation changes in eastern North America during the abrupt climate changes of the last deglaciation. We use the network of fossil-pollen records in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (www.neotomadb.org) and data contributed by individual investigators. Because many of these records were collected decades before the current generation of 14C and age-model technologies, we first developed a framework to assess the overall reliability of 14C chronologies by systematically evaluating individual 14C ages and associated chronologies. We developed a qualitative ranking scheme for individual 14C ages that combines information about their accuracy and precision. ‘Benchmark’ pollen records were defined to have at least one 14C age with an accuracy within 250 years and a precision less than 500 years that is within 1000 years of the time interval of interest, and at least five pollen samples per 1000 years across this time period. Only 22 of {\textgreater}350 late-Pleistocene pollen cores in eastern North America met the benchmark criteria.We then used Bayesian change-point analysis to identify widespread ecological events (Picea decline, Quercus rise, and Alnus decline), and interpolated the ages of these events from the benchmark sites to non-benchmark sites. Leave-one-out cross-validation analyses with the benchmark sites indicated that the spatial error associated with interpolation was less for inverse distance-weighting (IDW) than thin-plate splines (TPS) and was about 500 years for the three biotic events. By comparison, the difference between the original ages of events at poorly constrained sites and the biostratigraphic ages interpolated from the benchmark sites was close to 1000 years, suggesting that the use of biostratigraphic ages can significantly improve the age models for poorly constrained sites. Overall, these analyses suggest that the temporal resolution of multi-site syntheses of late-Pleistocene fossil-pollen data in eastern North America is about 500 years, a resolution that allows analysis of ecological responses to millennial-scale climate change during the last deglaciation.},

We report results from a comprehensive cladistic analysis using cranial, postcranial, and dental evidence including data from recently discovered Paleocene plesiadapiform skeletons (Ignacius clarkforkensis sp. nov.; Dryomomys szalayi, gen. et sp. nov.), and the most plesiomorphic extant tree shrew, Ptilocercus lowii. Our results, based on the fossil record, unambiguously place plesiadapiforms with Euprimates and indicate that the divergence of Primates (sensu lato) from other euarchontans likely occurred before or just after the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary (65 Mya), notably later than logistical model and molecular estimates. Anatomical features associated with specialized pedal grasping (including a nail on the hallux) and a petrosal bulla likely evolved in the common ancestor of Plesiadapoidea and Euprimates (Euprimateformes) by 62 Mya in either Asia or North America. Our results are consistent with those from recent molecular analyses that group Dermoptera with Scandentia. We find no evidence to support the hypothesis that any plesiadapiforms were mitten-gliders or closely related to Dermoptera.},

* 2 Here, a model linking macroecological patterns in abundance, distributional extent and body mass is developed, based on how the finite amount of energy available to the species in a region is divided between them. The energy available to a species is assumed to support some quantity of biomass, which must then be allocated to either many small-bodied or fewer larger-bodied individuals. This identifies a necessary link between population size and body mass, which predicts when the variety of relationships between these variables in the published literature are expected to occur.

How individuals use space determines the form of relationships between population size and distributional extent, distributional extent and body mass, and population density and body mass.

	abstract = {Surveying ecological communities often means the tedious work of collecting detailed information on each species within each sampling unit (e.g., trap, transect, quadrat). In this paper, we first argue that presence-absence and abundance data are the two extremes of a spectrum of data formats. By counting individuals of each species within a sampling unit until either a predefined (user-defined) number of individuals is reached or all individuals of the species are counted, all intermediate cases can be generated. By independently correlating each intermediate case with the complete abundance data, we show that it is not necessary to count all individuals to recover the patterns of variation characterizing a community data table. When the same procedure is applied in combination with different distance coefficients such as the Hellinger, chord, χ2, percentage difference or modified Gower, or the distance between species profiles, an even lower number of individuals per species need to be counted within a sampling unit for the patterns of variation defining a community to be recovered. By applying the same counting procedure to data collected during a pilot study, we show that the maximum number of individuals that need to be counted within a sampling unit for a species can be estimated from a pilot study containing as little as 3\% of randomly selected sampling units throughout the complete survey area. An example of how to apply this new counting method is presented, using data from a boreal forest Carabidae community sampled in northwestern Alberta, Canada. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Ant communities in tropical forests may be governed by varying assembly mechanisms, depending on the particular habitat investigated. We compared phylogenetic diversity and structure across two forest biomes (dry and humid) and two vertical layers (arboreal and terricolous) in ant communities in Madagascar, and assessed the influence of invasive species on this community structure. We estimated phylogenetic signal and correlated evolution for habitat and several functional traits and tested for conservatism in relevant functional and habitat traits. Ancestral states were reconstructed to illuminate the evolution of habitat traits. All analyses utilized phylogenies estimated from newly generated data from three nuclear markers for 290 Malagasy ant taxa. Dry forests, although lower in species richness, were found to support equally high lineage diversity as humid forests. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity was much lower in arboreal than in terricolous communities. We observed significant phylogenetic clustering in the combined humid forest and in the arboreal–humid, arboreal–dry and terricolous–humid communities, whereas the combined dry forest community was overdispersed. Among ant communities in Madagascar, overdispersion and competition therefore may be more prevalent in dry forest, and habitat filtering may be more dominant in humid forest. Excluding invasive ant species had little overall effect on community structure. All investigated traits showed low to intermediate conservatism; strong support for correlated evolution was found for increased eye size and an arboreal lifestyle. Habitat transitions from humid to dry and from terricolous to arboreal occurred more frequently, and ancestors of most lineages were predicted to be terricolous or humid-forest adapted. We conclude that most Malagasy ant clades first colonized humid forests and subsequently transitioned into dry forests, indicating that previous hypotheses on the evolution of Madagascar's hyperdiverse biota may not apply to ants and other arthropods.},

However, where archaeological studies are unable to quantify the costs and benefits associated with prey acquisition, they often rely on proxy measures such as prey body size, assuming it to be positively correlated with return rate. To examine this hypothesis, we analyze the results of 1,347 adult foraging bouts and 649 focal follows of contemporary Martu foragers in Australia's Western Desert. The data show that prey mobility is highly correlated with prey body size and is inversely related to pursuit success-meaning that prey body size is often an inappropriate proxy measure of prey rank. This has broad implications for future studies that rely on taxonomic measures of prey abundance to examine prehistoric human ecology, including but not limited to economic intensification, socioeconomic complexity, resource sustainability, and overexploitation. /// Mediante la integración de modelos de forrajeo de la ecología del comportamiento con las medidas de variabilidad en restos de fauna, estudios zooarqueológicos se han realizado importantes contribuciones para entender la prehistoria del uso de los recursos y las interacciones dinámicas entre los seres humanos y sus presas. Sin embargo, cuando los estudios arqueológicos no están en condiciones de cuantificar los costes y beneficios asociados con la adquisición de presas, a menudo dependen de parámetros de sustitución como presas tamaño corporal, suponiendo que se observa una correlación positiva con la tasa de retorno. Para examinar esta hipótesis, se analizan los resultados de 1,347 episodios de forrajeo y 649 focales de la siguiente de Martu, contemporáneo cazadores-recolectores en Australia del Desierto Occidental. Los datos muestran que la movilidad de presa se encuentra altamente correlacionado con el tamaño corporal presa y está en relación inversa a alcanzar el éxito-lo que significa que el tamaño corporal presas es a menudo una medida inadecuada representación de presa rango. Esto tiene amplias implicaciones para los estudios futuros que se basan en medidas taxonómica de la abundancia de presas para estudiar la ecología humana prehistórica, incluyendo pero no limitado a la intensificación económica, socio-económica complejidad, la sostenibilidad de los recursos, y la explotación excesiva.},

	abstract = {Aim

Beta diversity describes the variation in species composition between sites and can be used to infer why different species occupy different parts of the globe. It can be viewed in a number of ways. First, it can be partitioned into two distinct patterns: turnover and nestedness. Second, it can be investigated from either a species identity or a functional-trait point of view. We aim to document for the first time how these two aspects of beta diversity vary in response to a large environmental gradient.


Location

Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains, southern Africa.


Methods

We sampled ant assemblages along an extensive elevational gradient (900–3000 m a.s.l.) twice yearly for 7 years, and collected functional-trait information related to the species’ dietary and habitat-structure preferences. We used recently developed methods to partition species and functional beta diversity into their turnover and nestedness components. A series of null models were used to test whether the observed beta diversity patterns differed from random expectations.


Results

Species beta diversity was driven by turnover, but functional beta diversity was composed of both turnover and nestedness patterns at different parts of the gradient. Null models revealed that deterministic processes were likely to be responsible for the species patterns but that the functional changes were indistinguishable from stochasticity.


Main conclusions

Different ant species are found with increasing elevation, but they tend to represent an increasingly nested subset of the available functional strategies. This finding is unique and narrows down the list of possible factors that control ant existence across elevation. We conclude that diet and habitat preferences have little role in structuring ant assemblages in montane environments and that some other factor must be driving the non-random patterns of species turnover. This finding also highlights the importance of distinguishing between different kinds of beta diversity.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that the loss of a species from a community has the potential to cause a dramatic decline in biodiversity, for example through cascades of secondary extinctions, little is known about the factors contributing to the extinction risk of any particular species. Here we expand earlier modeling approaches using a dynamic food-web model that accounts for bottom-up as well as top-down effects. We investigate what factors influence a species’ extinction risk and time to extinction of the non-persistent species. We identified three basic properties that affect a species’ risk of extinction. The highest extinction risk is born by species with (1) low energy input (e.g. high trophic level), (2) susceptibility to the loss of energy pathways (e.g. specialists with few prey species) and (3) dynamic instability (e.g. low Hill exponent and reliance on homogeneous energy channels when feeding on similarly sized prey). Interestingly, and different from field studies, we found that the trophic level and not the body mass of a species influences its extinction risk. On the other hand, body mass is the single most important factor determining the time to extinction of a species, resulting in small species dying first. This suggests that in the field the trophic level might have more influence on the extinction risk than presently recognized.
Zusammenfassung
Obwohl wir wissen, dass Artensterben durch sekundäre Aussterbefälle weitreichende Verluste von Biodiversität in Artengemeinschaften auslösen kann, ist wenig bekannt über Faktoren, die das Aussterberisiko einer bestimmten Art beeinflussen. Hier erweitern wir frühere theoretische Arbeiten mit Hilfe eines dynamischen Nahrungsnetzmodells, das sowohl top-down als auch bottom-up Effekte berücksichtigt. Wir untersuchen welche Faktoren das Aussterberisiko und die Zeit bis zum Aussterben der nicht persistenten Arten beeinflussen. Wir identifizierten drei fundamentale Eigenschaften, die sich auf das Aussterberisiko einer Art auswirken. Das höchste Risiko tragen Arten mit (1) niedriger Energiezufuhr (z.B. mit hohem trophischen Level), (2) Anfälligkeit für den Verlust von Energiepfaden (z.B. Spezialisten mit wenig Beutearten) und (3) dynamischer Instabilität (z.B. mit niedrigem Hill Exponenten und Abhängigkeit von homogenen Energiepfaden durch Fraßan ähnlich großen Beutearten). Unser Modell zeigt, dass, anders als in Feldstudien festgestellt, nicht die Körpergröße einer Art sondern ihr trophischer Level ihr Aussterberisiko beeinflusst. Für die Zeit bis zum Aussterben auf der anderen Seite ist die Körpergröße der wichtigste bestimmende Faktor. Dies führt dazu, dass die kleinen Arten als Erste aussterben. Somit könnte sich der trophische Level einer Art mehr als bisher angenommen auf ihr Aussterberisiko auswirken.},

	abstract = {It is argued that "behavioral archaeology," as it has been advocated by M. B. Schiffer, represents a series of partially misguided postures relative to some important points of debate common in the 1960s. Due to failures to understand some points at issue, behavioral archaeologists appear to embrace many of the methods and goals of traditional archaeology, and thereby present a "reactionary" position rather than a "revisionist" position, as it has claimed. The issues upon which behavioral archaeology appears most reactionary are points most urgently in need of change, if archaeology is to progress as a discipline contributing both to our knowledge of the past and to our understanding of historical trends.},

The text then takes a look at the patterns of bone modifications produced by nonhuman agents and human modes of bone modification. Discussions focus on breakage related to other forms of bone processing, morphology of bone breakage, chopping and bone breakage as butchering techniques, butchering marks, bone breakage and destruction by animals, tooth marks, and previous approaches to understanding the significance of broken and modified bone.The manuscript ponders on patterns of association stemming from the behavior of man versus that of beast, as well as control collections of animal-structured assemblages; information on kill behavior and comparisons; observations of wolves and their behavior; and studies of assemblage composition caused by beasts. The publication is a valuable source of information for researchers interested in bone structure and modifications.},

Comparative studies of the observed materials are then presented with the aim of assessing the relative roles of hominids and other denning animals. It is concluded that, given our current knowledge of diagnostic criteria, nonhominid denning animals were the dominant agents responsible for the Zhoukoudian faunal remains and that, while hominids were certainly also involved, they are likely to have been scavenging animal products rather than hunting. Provocative evidence of the "roasting" of horse heads seems indicated for the recent ({\textless}250,000 years ago) levels at Zhoukoudian.},

	abstract = {Fossil bovids are described from the late Pliocene site of Ledi-Geraru, mainly from the Gurumaha and Lee Adoyta sedimentary packages (2.8–2.6 Ma). Finds include taxa already known from the slightly older Hadar Formation, such as the buffalo Ugandax coryndonae, the bongo-like Tragelaphus rastafari-nakuae lineage, an alcelaphin resembling Parmularius pachyceras, and a large impala. Differences from Hadar include the abundance of Kobus sigmoidalis, the absence of K. oricornus, and the presence of Tragelaphus gaudryi and probably also Menelikia lyrocera. The fossil bovids from Ledi-Geraru are mainly comparable to those known from contemporaneous assemblages in the Turkana Basin. Menelikia and T. gaudryi are characteristic of the Turkana Basin, and these are probably their first records from the Afar. A new species of Beatragus is also named. A well-preserved skull and skeleton of a fossil wildebeest from the Ogoyta sediments ({\textless}2.4 Ma) bears a mosaic of advanced and conserved traits that illuminate the evolution of the Connochaetes clade prior to the divergence of its two extant species. Taxonomic abundance, as well as functional analyses of postcranial elements, indicates that the ancient landscape at Ledi-Geraru was primarily made up of open habitats such as seasonal grasslands, with minor components of woodlands and wetlands. This contrasts with most localities from the Hadar Formation, which record more covered habitats. Comparisons with older Afar faunas indicate that environmental changes to drier and more open habitats were part of a long-term trend that goes back to at least 4 Ma, if not earlier.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:0A4AF06A-9918-4AFE-B3D1-633DE036EDCBSUPPLEMENTAL DATA—Supplemental materials are available for this article for free at www.tandfonline.com/UJVP Citation for this article: Bibi, F., J.

	abstract = {The development of the Ethiopian biogeographic realm since the late Miocene is here explored with the presentation and review of fossil evidence from eastern Africa. Prostrepsiceros cf. vinayaki and an unknown species of possible caprin affinity are described from the hominid-bearing Asa Koma and Kuseralee Members (∼5.7 and ∼5.2 Ma) of the Middle Awash, Ethiopia. The Middle Awash Prostrepsiceros cf. vinayaki constitutes the first record of this taxon from Africa, previously known from the Siwaliks and Arabia. The possible caprin joins a number of isolated records of caprin or caprin-like taxa recorded, but poorly understood, from the late Neogene of Africa. The identification of these two taxa from the Middle Awash prompts an overdue review of fossil bovids from the sub-Saharan African record that demonstrate Eurasian affinities, including the reduncin Kobus porrecticornis, and species of Tragoportax. The fossil bovid record provides evidence for greater biological continuity between Africa and Eurasia in the late Miocene and earliest Pliocene than is found later in time. In contrast, the early Pliocene (after 5 Ma) saw the loss of any significant proportions of Eurasian-related taxa, and the continental dominance of African-endemic taxa and lineages, a pattern that continues today.},

	abstract = {The Equations Underlying Cities
Cities are complex systems of which functioning depends upon many social, economic, and environmental factors. Bettencourt (p. 1438; see the cover; see the Perspective by Batty) developed a theory to explain the quantitative relationships observed between various aspects of cities and population size or land area.
Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand them scientifically and manage them in practice has remained limited. The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.
Cities of all sizes can be modeled as interdependent networks of interactions and infrastructure. [Also see Perspective by Batty]

	abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, β, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have β ≈1.2 {\textgreater}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display β ≈0.8 {\textless}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which β{\textless}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

	abstract = {Eurygnathohippus is a genus of hipparionine horse that evolved in and was confined to the African continent from the late Miocene to Pleistocene interval. Eurygnathohippus woldegabrieli is a new species from Aramis, Ethiopia, dated between 4.4 and 4.2 Ma. The hypodigm is currently restricted to 157 specimens from 14 Aramis localities and one nearby Gona locality. We nominate a mandible as the type and a maxillary dentition and two complete metacarpal IIIs as paratypes. Our analysis reveals that Eurygnathohippus woldegabrieli is derived compared with late Miocene Eurygnathohippus feibeli in its overall size, cheek tooth crown height, mandibular symphysis length, and robusticity of distal limb elements. It is primitive in mandibular symphysis length and robusticity of distal limb elements compared with the more advanced medial Pliocene species Eurygnathohippus hasumense. A study of Eurygnathohippus woldegabrieli's paleodiet as measured by two mesowear methods, corroborated by carbon isotope studies, reveals that it was a dedicated grazer with a coarse C4 diet akin to that of modern zebras, wildebeests, and white rhinoceroses.

He then provides a historical overview of thye events in question, beginning with the decision and program to build the atomic bomb. Detailing the sequence of events leading to Japan's surrender, he revisits the decisive battles of the Pacific War and the motivations of American and Japanese leaders. Finally, Kort examines ten key issues in the discussion of Hiroshima and guides readers to relevant primary source documents, scholarly books, and articles.},

This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of H. naledi is unique, but most similar to early Homo species including Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. H. naledi has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09560.001, Modern humans, or Homo sapiens, are now the only living species in their genus. But as recently as 100,000 years ago, there were several other species that belonged to the genus Homo. Together with modern humans, these extinct human species, our immediate ancestors and their close relatives, are collectively referred to as ‘hominins’., Now Berger et al. report the recent discovery of an extinct species from the genus Homo that was unearthed from deep underground in what has been named the Dinaledi Chamber, in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa. The species was named Homo naledi; ‘naledi’ means ‘star’ in Sotho (also called Sesotho), which is one of the languages spoken in South Africa., The unearthed fossils were from at least 15 individuals and include multiple examples of most of the bones in the skeleton. Based on this wide range of specimens from a single site, Berger et al. describe Homo naledi as being similar in size and weight to a small modern human, with human-like hands and feet. Furthermore, while the skull had several unique features, it had a small braincase that was most similar in size to other early hominin species that lived between four million and two million years ago. Homo naledi's ribcage, shoulders and pelvis also more closely resembled those of earlier hominin species than those of modern humans., The Homo naledi fossils are the largest collection of a single species of hominin that has been discovered in Africa so far and, in a related study, Dirks et al. describe the setting and context for these fossils. However, since the age of the fossils remains unclear, one of the next challenges will be to date the remains to provide more information about the early evolution of humans and their close relatives., DOI:

The Hunters or the Hunted? is a very important book for paleoanthropology. It presents the first thorough analysis of the Sterkfontein Valley assemblages, contributes significantly to the resolution of lingering controversies and, by placing the old information in a fresh perspective, enables new and more sophisticated questions to be asked not only of the South African material but of similar assemblages elsewhere. Another contribution is that it reinforces the recent change in feelings as to what constitutes data, for the value of looking at fossil and contemporary bones as closely as this is clear. Brain urges the necessity of recovering fossils with a high regard for subtle detail. I hope excavators of any vertebrate fossil site will be persuaded to follow his advice and pay more attention to these features of bone accumulations that have been previously neglected; for taphonomy can be a powerful tool in elucidating the problems of fossil assemblages, especially when handled with the care and caution that Brain brings to the subject. -Andrew Hill, Nature},

	abstract = {Understanding what mechanisms shape the diversity and composition of biological assemblages across broad-scale gradients is central to ecology. Litter-consuming detritivorous invertebrates in streams show an unusual diversity gradient, with α-diversity increasing towards high latitudes but no trend in γ-diversity. We hypothesized this pattern to be related to shifts in nestedness and several ecological processes shaping their assemblages (dispersal, environmental filtering and competition). We tested this hypothesis, using a global dataset, by examining latitudinal trends in nestedness and several indicators of the above processes along the latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that strong environmental filtering and low dispersal in the tropics lead to often species-poor local detritivore assemblages, nested in richer regional assemblages. At higher latitudes, dispersal becomes stronger, disrupting the nested assemblage structure and resulting in local assemblages that are generally more species-rich and non-nested subsets of the regional species pools. Our results provide evidence that mechanisms underlying assemblage composition and diversity of stream litter-consuming detritivores shift across latitudes, and provide an explanation for their unusual pattern of increasing α-diversity with latitude. When we repeated these analyses for whole invertebrate assemblages of leaf litter and for abundant taxa showing reverse or no diversity gradients we found no latitudinal patterns, suggesting that function-based rather than taxon-based analyses of assemblages may help elucidate the mechanisms behind diversity gradients.},

I demonstrate, through the use of a modified bootstrap analysis, that there is no difference between the longevity of families becoming extinct during times of background extinction and times of mass extinction. In both mass and background extinction intervals the mean age of families that become extinct is 2 standard deviations below the geometric mean taxon age of families available for extinction. Young families are more susceptible to extinction, perhaps as the result of lower species richness or of occupying a smaller geographic range. There is no tendency during mass extinctions toward loss of families with different taxon ages other than those that become extinct during background times. Thus, in terms of family survival, mass extinction appears to be an exaggeration of processes of background extinction.},

To test the hypothesis that this event featured the dispersal of groups from Asia to North America and Europe, we used isotope stratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and quantitative biochronology to constrain the relative age of important Asian faunas. The extinct family Hyaenodontidae appeared in Asia before it did so in North America, and the modern orders Primates, Artiodactyla, and Perissodactyla first appeared in Asia at or before the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. These results are consistent with Asia being a center for early mammalian origination.},

Regression of log-transformed data demonstrated that more variance in maximum dispersal distance could be explained by home range area (74\%) than could be explained by body size (50\%). The relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range size was isometric (slope = 1) when the square root of home range area (i.e., linear dimension of home range) was used. Thus, maximum dispersal distance was related to home range size by a single constant  of 40. A linear relationship remained between these two variables after the effects of body size were removed (F = 31.6, df = 1, 32, P = 3.2 × 10−6, R2 = 0.50). A similar isometric relationship with home range size was found for median dispersal distance (related by a multiple of 7). This isometric relationship between dispersal distance and home range size was tested using a second data source: maximum movements made by mammals after translocation, which also was linearly related to home range area (F = 94.5, df = 1, 23, P = 1.3 × 10−9, R2 = 0.81). The slope and intercept of this relationship were not different from those of the relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range area. We suggest that the vagility of mammals affected both home range size and dispersal distance (or movement after translocation) independently of body size, such that these movements could be predicted by home range area better than by body size alone. The resulting isometric relationship between dispersal distance and home range size has potential as a useful scaling rule for ecological practitioners.},

	abstract = {Spatial structures may not only result from ecological interactions, they may also play an essential functional role in organizing the interactions. Modeling spatial patterns at multiple spatial and temporal scales is thus a crucial step to understand the functioning of ecological communities. PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) analysis achieves a spectral decomposition of the spatial relationships among the sampling sites, creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set. The analysis then finds the scales to which a data table of interest responds. The significant PCNM variables can be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales, or included in a procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. This paper presents four applications of PCNM analysis to ecological data representing combinations of: transect or surface data, regular or irregular sampling schemes, univariate or multivariate data. The data sets include Amazonian ferns, tropical marine zooplankton, chlorophyll in a marine lagoon, and oribatid mites in a peat bog. In each case, new ecological knowledge was obtained through PCNM analysis.},

Question:

Is Rao's quadratic entropy a suitable measure of functional diversity if several traits are considered?


Methods:

It is checked whether Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) satisfies a priori criteria suggested by Mason et al. A real data set is used to show that there are often zeros in abundance distributions which maximize functional diversity.


Results and Conclusion:

FDQ fulfils all a priori criteria and it surpasses other proposed indices, because it includes species abundances and more than one trait. Therefore, it seems to be an improvement compared to measures of functional diversity that are currently available. An unexpected property of FDQ is that its value may decrease if species richness increases. The reason is that functional diversity is influenced by both species-abundance based diversity and differences among species. Introduction of a new species into the community increases the species-abundance based diversity, while it may decrease the average dissimilarity among species.},

Both comparative and experimental evidence indicate that beliefs in moralizing high gods promote cooperation among humans, a behavioral attribute known to correlate with environmental harshness in nonhuman animals. Here we combine fine-grained bioclimatic data with the latest statistical tools from ecology and the social sciences to evaluate the potential effects of environmental forces, language history, and culture on the global distribution of belief in moralizing high gods (n = 583 societies). After simultaneously accounting for potential nonindependence among societies because of shared ancestry and cultural diffusion, we find that these beliefs are more prevalent among societies that inhabit poorer environments and are more prone to ecological duress. In addition, we find that these beliefs are more likely in politically complex societies that recognize rights to movable property. Overall, our multimodel inference approach predicts the global distribution of beliefs in moralizing high gods with an accuracy of 91\%, and estimates the relative importance of different potential mechanisms by which this spatial pattern may have arisen. The emerging picture is neither one of pure cultural transmission nor of simple ecological determinism, but rather a complex mixture of social, cultural, and environmental influences. Our methods and findings provide a blueprint for how the increasing wealth of ecological, linguistic, and historical data can be leveraged to understand the forces that have shaped the behavior of our own species.},

	abstract = {Consideration of the Phanerozoic fossil record, made up predominantly of level-bottom, marine, benthic organisms, indicates that it may be subdivided into twelve Ecologic-Evolutionary Units. Within each of these units the varied community groups of level-bottom organisms maintain their generic integrity from beginning to end of the time interval. But, the species of the more endemic, more stenotopic genera tend to evolve in a manner most easily interpreted as phyletic, and time-sympatric. This phyletic, time-sympatric, species-level evolution of some genera has no effect on that element of fitness having to do with relative abundance, and is neutral in that sense. Within each of these twelve level-bottom Ecologic-Evolutionary Units there may be varied numbers of non-level-bottom, reef-complex, pelmatozoan thicket-complex, etc. community group types. All of this indicates that evolution within each of the Ecologic-Evolutionary Units is tightly constrained by ecologic factors--there are no random adaptive radiations, or genera drifting from one community group to another, i.e., overall behaviors and physiologies are not in a continual state of flux. Using these data one may then provide far better evaluations of diversity changes through geologic time that are less biased by monographic effects. It is clear that the geologic Periods are not always suitable units for diversity measurements because they do not always accord with Ecologic-Evolutionary Unit boundaries. It is pointed out that nonmarine evolution is largely decoupled from the marine, and that one expects nonmarine Ecologic-Evolutionary Units to be different from those present in the marine environment. Correlations with a number of classes of geologic variables and the boundaries of the Ecologic-Evolutionary Units at present do not appear to be strong enough to be termed causal with much confidence. Further work might change this situation.},

False stasis can result from a sustained pattern of emigration and immigration, and geographic variation must be studied in order to posit an unambiguous case of punctuated equilibrium. We describe a statistical method based on the general linear model for testing the relative fit of the alternative hypotheses to any set of temporally ordered metric data. Our method is hierarchical in the sense that subsets of the total explained variance can themselves be explained. The size of the first molar of the primate Pelycodus and of the condylarth Hyopsodus are analyzed.

This paper reviews principal theorems from the mathematical literature of random walk and shows how they may be applied to empirical data by scaling net changes according to the square root of elapsed time. The notorious pair of "opposite" findings, equilibrium and anagenesis, may be construed as deviations from random walk in opposite directions. Malmgren's data on Globorotalia tumida, previously interpreted as an example of punctuated anagenesis, are consistent with a random walk showing neither punctuation nor anagenesis, but instead varying in speed over four subsequences.},

In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales.

The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis.

To explore this issue, we compared the performances of the Mantel correlogram to those of other methods, using numerical simulations based on random, normally distributed data. For a single response variable, we compared it to the Moran and Geary correlograms. Type I error rates of the three methods were correct. Power of the Mantel correlogram was nearly as high as that of the univariate methods. For the multivariate case, the test of the multivariate variogram developed in the context of multiscale ordination is in fact a Mantel test, so that the power of the two methods is the same by definition. We devised an alternative permutation test based on the variance, which yielded similar results. Overall, the power of the Mantel test was high, the method successfully detecting spatial correlation at rates similar to the permutation test of the variance statistic in multivariate variograms.

	abstract = {The distribution and abundance of trees can be strongly affected by disturbance such as fire. In mixed tree/grass ecosystems, recurrent grass-fuelled fires can strongly suppress tree saplings and therefore control tree dominance. We propose that changes in atmospheric [CO2] could influence tree cover in such metastable ecosystems by altering their postburn recovery rates relative to flammable herbaceous growth forms such as grasses. Slow sapling recovery rates at low [CO2] would favour the spread of grasses and a reduction of tree cover. To test the possible importance of [CO2]/fire interactions, we first used a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) to simulate biomass in grassy ecosystems in South Africa with and without fire. The results indicate that fire has a major effect under higher rainfall conditions suggesting an important role for fire/[CO2] interactions. We then used a demographic model of the effects of fire on mesic savanna trees to test the importance of grass/tree differences in postburn recovery rates. We adjusted grass and tree growth in the model according to the DGVM output of net primary production at different [CO2] relative to current conditions. The simulations predicted elimination of trees at [CO2] typical of the last glacial period (180 ppm) because tree growth rate is too slow (15 years) to grow to a fire-proof size of ca. 3 m. Simulated grass growth would produce an adequate fuel load for a burn in only 2 years. Simulations of preindustrial [CO2] (270 ppm) predict occurrence of trees but at low densities. The greatest increase in trees occurs from preindustrial to current [CO2] (360 ppm). The simulations are consistent with palaeo-records which indicate that trees disappeared from sites that are currently savannas in South Africa in the last glacial. Savanna trees reappeared in the Holocene. There has also been a large increase in trees over the last 50–100 years. We suggest that slow tree recovery after fire, rather than differential photosynthetic efficiencies in C3 and C4 plants, might have been the significant factor in the Late Tertiary spread of flammable grasslands under low [CO2] because open, high light environments would have been a prerequisite for the spread of C4 grasses. Our simulations suggest further that low [CO2] could have been a significant factor in the reduction of trees during glacial times, because of their slower regrowth after disturbance, with fire favouring the spread of grasses.},

Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire, herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors belowground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C4 grassy biomes.},

Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by “moment closure,” neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.},

Here we present a conceptual framework to quantify the mismatch between optimal conditions for species occurrence and multiple measures of population and individual performance (density, adult growth and survival, and recruitment) and the associated performance reduction, or cost. We quantified these mismatches for 59 tree species in the western US along a soil water balance gradient and found high variability in mismatches among species and among performance measures, often resulting in high costs. We used functional traits to explore how dispersal limitation, migration lags, and competitive exclusion may cause mismatches. Overall, the large variability in mismatches, their costs and the relationship with functional traits highlight the nuanced relationships between species’ performance and their distributions.},

	abstract = {The exhibition of increasingly intensive and complex niche construction behaviors through time is a key feature of human evolution, culminating in the advanced capacity for ecosystem engineering exhibited by Homo sapiens. A crucial outcome of such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure. We outline key examples of these changes, highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well as the application of new statistical and computational methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity—the Late Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence of early urbanized societies and commercial networks. Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the world. This record has implications for ecological and evolutionary research, conservation strategies, and the maintenance of ecosystem services, pointing to a significant need for broader cross-disciplinary engagement between archaeology and the biological and environmental sciences.},

The revision of the Hippopotamidae initiated here deals with the last 8 Myr of African and Asian species. The first thorough cladistic analysis of the family is presented here. The outcome of this analysis, including 37 morphological characters coded for 15 extant and fossil taxa, as well as non-coded features of mandibular morphology, was used to reconstruct broad outlines of hippo phylogeny. Distinct lineages within the paraphyletic genus Hexaprotodon are recognized and characterized. In order to harmonize taxonomy and phylogeny, two new genera are created. The genus name Choeropsis is re-validated for the extant Liberian hippo. The nomen Hexaprotodon is restricted to the fossil lineage mostly known in Asia, but also including at least one African species. The genus Hippopotamus is confirmed. These changes represent substantial advances for understanding the evolutionary history of the Hippopotamidae, and provide a new framework for future studies. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 143, 1–26.},

	abstract = {The origin of late Neogene Hippopotamidae (Artiodactyla) involves one of the most serious conflicts between comparative anatomy and molecular biology: is Artiodactyla paraphyletic? Molecular comparisons indicate that Cetacea should be the modern sister group of hippos. This finding implies the existence of a fossil lineage linking cetaceans (first known in the early Eocene) to hippos (first known in the middle Miocene). The relationships of hippos within Artiodactyla are challenging, and the immediate affinities of Hippopotamidae have been studied by biologists for almost two centuries without resolution. Here, we compare opposing hypotheses implicating several “suiform” families. This morphological analysis of a comprehensive set of taxa and characters offers a robust solution to the origins of Hippopotamidae. This family appears to be deeply nested within the otherwise extinct artiodactyl family Anthracotheriidae, most precisely within the most advanced selenodont forms. The proposed sister group of hippos is the middle to late Miocene African semiaquatic Libycosaurus. Any close relationships of hippos with suoids, particularly with Tayassuidae, are rejected. Furthermore, the clade (Hippopotamidae, Anthracotheriidae) is proposed as the sister group of the Cetacea, offering broad morphological support for a molecular phylogeny, such support being also consistent with the fossil record. Corroboration of this relationship requires an exploration of anthracothere affinities with other Paleogene artiodactyls. Among those, the position of Ruminantia is a central question, still to be solved. Further progress in this debate is likely to come from morphological studies of paleontological data, whether known or still to be discovered.},

	abstract = {We apply historical biogeography techniques to the macaques, baboons and their relatives (Primata: Papionini) and relate the inferred history of range shifts, and associated evolutionary events, to the latitudinal distribution of extant species, which is strongly tropical. The results of reversible parsimony, weighted ancestral area and dispersal-vicariance analyses all agree that Central Africa was part of the range of the ancestor of the tribe. Tropical regions with high current species richness (Central Africa, South-east Asia, Indonesia) have: (1) had a relatively long history of occupation, (2) experienced both a greater number and a greater average rate of speciation events and (3) given rise to more dispersal events to other regions. However, nested sister-taxon comparisons across the tribe show no overall association between differences in latitude and differences in rates of cladogenesis. Our historical reconstructions are largely consistent with previous hypotheses and fossil data, and suggest that both the passage of time since colonization and rates of cladogenesis have enhanced tropical species richness. Historical biogeography may thus considerably aid understanding of this and other spatial problems in macroecology. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 85, 235–246.},

To examine whether there is a phylogenetic structure to such episodes of changes in encephalization across mammals, we used phylogenetic techniques to analyse brain mass, body mass and encephalization quotient (EQ) among 630 extant mammalian species. Among all mammals, anthropoid primates and odontocete cetaceans have significantly greater variance in EQ, suggesting that evolutionary constraints that result in a strict correlation between brain and body mass have independently become relaxed. Moreover, ancestral state reconstructions of absolute brain mass, body mass and EQ revealed patterns of increase and decrease in EQ within anthropoid primates and cetaceans.

We use stratocladistics here to provide an overview of the phylogeny of the extinct echinoderm class Blastoidea. Both cladistic and stratocladistic methods evaluate alternative phylogenies by comparing the number of ad hoc hypotheses needed to reconcile each alternative to observed data. Minimization of ad hoc hypotheses selects the phylogeny best supported by data and enables phylogenetic analyses to incorporate data from different sources. Cladistics treats ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy, whereas stratocladistics additionally considers ad hoc hypotheses of differential preservation probability of lineages in the stratigraphic record.The blastoid phylogeny derived using stratocladistics is more resolved than hypotheses selected by cladistics. Although the morphological characters are relatively homoplasious, in this instance the stratigraphic ordering of fossils provides both structure and altered polarity for the stratocladistic hypothesis. The stratocladistic phylogeny supports previous paleontological conclusions of convergence among blastoid lineages and facilitates evaluation of specific hypotheses of character transformation that are integral to recent systematic revisions. Additionally, consideration of temporal data makes some hypotheses of ancestor-descendant relationships more parsimonious than hypotheses of derivation from a common ancestor. The ability to recognize sequential members within single lineages allows more accurate estimation of faunal diversities and more specific reconstruction of evolutionary histories. Chief among possible confounding factors in stratocladistics are instances where preservation potential shows significant geographic variation, although problems of preservation are more tractable than the difficulties homoplasy presents for cladistic analysis.},

We compared these attributes among flowering plants, grasshoppers, butterflies, lizards, summer birds, winter birds, and rodents across 48 plots in the grasslands and mesquite—oak savannas of southeastern Arizona. Species richness and evenness were uncorrelated or weakly negatively correlated for each taxonomic group, supporting the conclusion that richness alone is an incomplete measure of diversity. In each case, richness was positively correlated with one or more measures of abundance. By contrast, evenness usually was negatively correlated with the abundance variables, reflecting the fact that plots with high evenness generally were those where all species present were about equally uncommon. Therefore richness, but not evenness, usually was a positive predictor of places of conservation value, if these are defined as places where species of interest are especially abundant. Species diversity was more positively correlated with evenness than with richness among grasshoppers and flowering plants, in contrast to the other taxonomic groups, and the positive correlations between richness and abundance were comparatively weak for grasshoppers and plants as well. Both of these differences can be attributed to the fact that assemblages of plants and grasshoppers were numerically dominated by small subsets of common species (grasses and certain spur-throated grasshoppers) whose abundances differed greatly among plots in ways unrelated to species richness of the groups as a whole.},

In the present time (now called the Anthropocene), most species of large terrestrial herbivores are threatened with extinction as their populations decline and their geographic ranges collapse under the pressure of human hunting, poaching, and encroachment (1). Although the scale of ongoing anthropogenic ecological disruptions is unprecedented, human-driven extinctions are not new: There is strong evidence that humans played a major role in the wave of megafaunal losses at the end of the Pleistocene, between about 10,000 and 50,000 years ago (2). But when did humans, or our ancestors, begin to have such a profound effect on large herbivores to the point of causing extinctions? On page 938 of this issue, Faith et al. (3) provide evidence to help answer this question. They track the number of megaherbivore species (mammals weighing more than 1000 kg) in eastern Africa from the late Miocene, about 7 million years ago, to the present. Their analysis indicates that megaherbivore diversity began to decline in the early Pliocene, about 4.6 million years ago.

	abstract = {After decades of fieldwork spurred by the search for human ancestors, paleontologists in East Africa are compiling networks of databases to address questions of long-term evolutionary, environmental, and ecological change. Paleontological databases from the Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia (East Turkana, West Turkana, Kanapoi, Lothagam, and Omo) and the Hadar Basin of Ethiopia’s Afar region consist of nearly 70,000 specimens of fossil vertebrates (mostly mammals) that date from the late Miocene to the Pleistocene. Here we focus on the most abundant family of fossil mammals, the Bovidae (N = 8213 specimens), and illustrate patterns of taxonomic abundance and diversity from about 7 Ma (million years ago) to about 1 Ma. The key questions we address are the following: How much variation in patterns of faunal change is there within different areas of a large sedimentary basin? How much variation is there between basins? How are these patterns related to broad signals of climatic change? What are the implications of the bovids for East African environments and for hominin evolution in the late Cenozoic? A correspondence analysis of bovid tribes indicates that important differences in taxonomic abundance existed among different areas of the Turkana Basin, and that some of these differences had environmental implications. The lower Omo Valley appears to have remained distinct from other parts of the Turkana Basin between 3 and 2 Ma, with consistently higher proportions of Tragelaphini and Aepycerotini, and at times of Reduncini and Bovini. These bovids are indicative of woodlands or forests (Aepycerotini and Tragelaphini) or of moist grasslands near wooded habitats (Reduncini and Bovini). An analysis of bovid tribes indicative of open and seasonally arid grasslands (Alcelaphini, Antilopini, and Hippotragini) shows relatively high proportions of these bovids in the West Turkana areas, but very low proportions in the Omo, especially prior to about 2 Ma. This indicates that the Omo remained wetter and more wooded than other parts of the Turkana Basin for much of the Plio-Pleistocene, while the West Turkana area appears to have been more open than other parts of the basin, and East Turkana had conditions intermediate between those at West Turkana and those in the Omo. Fossil bovids from the Hadar Basin suggest diverse environments including woodlands, wet grasslands, and drier savanna grasslands. An increase in the abundance of arid adapted bovids in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene of the Turkana and Hadar Basins provides evidence that faunal changes in these different areas were driven by common factors consistent with the known record of climatic change. Analyses of species diversity among bovids show three peaks of richness in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The first peak occurred at about 3.8–3.4 Ma, the second at 2.8–2.4 Ma, and the last from about 2.0 to 1.4 Ma. The last two of these peaks coincide with previously identified periods of high faunal turnover in East Africa. Although climate appears to have shaped major patterns in the evolution of bovids, the fact that different areas of a single sedimentary basin show distinct responses highlights the complexities involved in establishing causal links between paleoclimate and evolution.},

	abstract = {We present a preliminary predictive model of Oldowan stone artefact and scavenged larger mammal bone assemblages for 11 landscape facets modeled earlier to occur across a large portion (\&gt;300 km2) of the paleo-Olduvai Basin during lowermost Bed II times. This second phase of model-building is based on our earlier characterizations of the basin's landscape ecostructure and the inter-facet distribution of key resources and hazards probably encountered by Late Pliocene hominids (Peters \&amp; Blumenschine, 1995, 1996). Our current extension of the model of hominid–landscape interactions specifies additional theoretical components, including: (1) the assumed capabilities of Oldowan hominids (presumablyHomo habilis, primarily); (2) the landscape-facet-specific tasks they carried out; (3) the immediate stone and bone task residues they produced; and (4) the predicted composition, condition, density, and clustering of stone artefact and butchered and unbutchered bone assemblages for each facet. We develop ecological linkages between these new and formerly reported modeling components, the most fundamental of which is the facet-specific degree of tree/shrub cover abundance, and the correlated degree of competition among larger carnivores and hominids for scavengeable larger mammal carcasses. These factors condition variability among landscape facets in scavenging opportunities encountered by hominids, which in our model is the major predictor of bone and stone artefact assemblage composition. The predictive value of scavenging reflects the bias of paleoanthropological traces toward technology and butchery in their landscape context, but the model is surprisingly insensitive to what are usually thought to be critical social components of hominid land use. The predictions for the traces of hominid–landscape interactions modeled herein can be tested in the future against the landscape archaeological sample being excavated from lowermost Bed II by the Olduvai Landscape Paleoanthropology Project.},

Published skeletal part profiles from the two archaeological sites are evaluated using (i) modern observations on the sequence by which carnivores consume carcass parts in order to assess the timing of hominid access to carcasses, and (ii) measurements of flesh and marrow yields to assess the tissue types sought and acquired. These results suggest that the maximization of marrow (fat) yields, not flesh (protein) yields, was the criterion shaping decisions about carcass processing. Because of evidence for density-dependent destruction of some flesh-bearing parts by scavengers of the hominid-butchered assemblages, however, it is uncertain whether carcass parts were transported and acquired by hominids in a largely defleshed condition. The results on tissue types acquired are combined with a discussion of predation risk, feeding competition and the equipment needs of carcass processing in an attempt to identify archaeological test implications of competing hypotheses for the socio-economic function of the earliest archaeological sites.},

The hypotheses advanced by Bunn (1986; Bunn and Kroll, 1986) and Leakey (197l), and by Binford (198l, 1986) are tested using the proportion of long bone specimens bearing hammerstone percussion marks and carnivore tooth marks. Unambiguous test implications based on surface mark frequencies are provided by results of well controlled experiments and naturalistic observations that model three alternative sequences of long bone processing and consumption by hominids and/or carnivores. Percussion mark and tooth mark frequencies, reported systematically for the first time on the assemblage from FLK Zinjanthropus, allow the rejection of the hypothesis that carnivores rather than hominids at FLK Zinjanthropus enjoyed first access to marrow in long bone cavities. This result contradicts Binford's characterization of Plio-Pleistocene hominids as marginal scavengers of carcasses heavily ravaged by bone-crunching carnivores. However, a high proportion of tooth-marked long bone midshaft fragments allows the rejection of the alternative hypothesis that carnivore access to long bones was exclusively or even primarily secondary to butchery and marrow extraction by hominids, as argued by Bunn (1986; Bunn and Kroll, 1986) and Leakey (1971). The results show that the sequence of carnivore and hominid access to long bones, and their respective carcass tissue yields, was more complex, as is consistent with a dominantly passive scavenging mode of carcass acquisition by hominids hypothesized earlier on the basis of skeletal part data and paleoecological considerations.

Confidence in these deductions based on surface mark frequencies is increased by demonstrations of (i) a close comparability in agencies of bone fragmentation between the control samples and FLK Zinjanthropus; (ii) the representativeness of the control samples with respect to the process-pattern relationship between marrow/grease extraction and frequencies of surface marking; and (iii) the energetic and mechanical uniformities linking rates of bone surface marking to the timing of carnivore and hominid access to long bone nutrients.},

The results of disturbance by mainly spotted hyaenas to simulated archaeological assemblages of hammerstone-broken bovid limb bones show that assemblages accumulated and fed upon by hominids first will nonetheless still be attractive to bone-ravaging carnivores. Such experimental assemblages usually show a virtually complete deletion of epiphyseal fragments, and a maximum incidence of tooth-marked long bone fragments of 45\%, with an average of approximately 15\%. The results therefore provide for the first time a quantified explanation of how an archaeological bone assemblage can come to bear traces of both taphonomic agents. Assemblages accumulated and fed upon first by spotted hyaenas, in contrast, preserve an incidence of tooth-marked long bone fragments in excess of 67\% and averaging approximately 82\%. The different intensities of tooth marking are accompanied by equally distinctive incidences of features of hammerstone breakage. Within constraints imposed by physical taphonomic and other factors, these criteria provide a means for testing the primacy of hominids over carnivores in the accumulation of fossil bone assemblages.},

Using low-cost and high-volume hand lens and low-power light microscope techniques, we determined the presence or absence of conspicuous and inconspicuous marks with 97\% three-way correspondence, and diagnosed marks of known origin to actor and effector with 99\% accuracy. Novices with less than 3 h training on control collections correctly diagnosed 86\% of classic but mainly inconspicuous marks. Novices spending several more hours studying control specimens elevated their diagnostic accuracy on morphologically representative marks to near-expert levels of 95\%.

Our results show that published cautions about mimicry among cut marks, percussion marks, and carnivore tooth marks are overstated. All types of marks examined can be identified reliably, regardless of conspicuousness. As such, fully standardized comparisons of mark frequencies can be drawn among assemblages, even those documented by different analysts. However, such robust interpretations can be attained only if analysts base diagnoses on (a) a firm familiarity with bones marked under strictly controlled conditions, (b) the systematic application of published morphological and contextual criteria, and (c) the use of prescribed low-power magnification techniques.},

We argue that a testable and detailed behavioral ecology of prehistoric hominids must be grounded in such ecologically-oriented middle range research. We provide a zooarchaeological case study that recasts the current debates over carcass acquisition by early hominids and the socio-economic function of early archaeological sites within the framework provided by our behavioral-ecological approach. Specifically, we use the results of field studies and experiments to examine the ecological conditions and behavioral strategies that may have increased or decreased competition between hominids and carnivores for carcass foods. The case study generates testable hypotheses regarding the ecological causes and behavioral consequences of various foraging strategies that have been advanced for early hominids.},

The number of bones by which individuals are represented, skeletal part profiles, and the completeness of surviving bones are shown to differ among three settings: Ngorongoro Crater, the Acacia woodlands and grass plains of the Serengeti, and riparian woodlands of the Serengeti. These differences are correlated directly to the scale of scavenging opportunities previously documented for these ecosystems and habitats. The results are explicable through reference to the sequence in which spotted hyenas consume carcass parts, and their competitively-induced motivation to destroy bone before its edible contents decompose.

This confounds comparisons between modern and fossil communities, which are sampled across very different scales, especially temporal ones. We use a recent bone dataset (i.e., “death assemblages”) from a modern ecosystem to explore spatial, temporal and taxonomic scaling in biodiversity assessments. Our ultimate goal is to create a model based on these scaling relationships to facilitate meaningful comparisons between modern and fossil communities. Location Amboseli National Park, southern Kenya. Time period Mid-1960 s to present day. Major taxa studied Large mammals ({\textgreater}1 kg). Methods We implemented a random placement null model and used model selection methods to investigate how species richness at Amboseli scales as a function of time and area [i.e., the species–time–area relationship (STAR) model]. We then analysed how the model coefficients change at different taxonomic scales (i.e., genus, family, order). Results In agreement with previous studies, we find species richness scales positively with time and area but with a negative interaction between the two. Rates of richness turnover decrease as taxonomic scale increases. Main conclusions We hypothesize that decreasing rates of turnover with increasing spatial and/or temporal scale are caused by taking progressively larger samples from a species pool that is changing at a slower rate relative to turnover at the scale of sampling. Because increasing area and time are simply alternative ways of uncovering the species pool, increased time-averaging of communities results in a more spatially averaged ecological signal. Increasing taxonomic scale causes turnover rates to decrease because of how lower-level taxa are aggregated into coarser, higher-level ones. The STAR model presents a framework for extrapolating and comparing richness between small-scale modern and large-scale fossil communities, as well as a means to understand the general processes involved with changing scale.},

	abstract = {: Actualistic observations form the basis of many taphonomic studies in paleontology. However, surveys limited by environment or taxon may not be applicable far beyond the bounds of the initial observations. Even when multiple studies exploring the potential variety within a taphonomic process exist, quantitative methods for comparing these datasets in order to identify larger scale patterns have been understudied. This research uses modern bite marks collected from 21 of the 23 generally recognized species of extant Crocodylia to explore statistical and phylogenetic methods of synthesizing taphonomic datasets. Bite marks were identified, and specimens were then coded for presence or absence of different mark morphotypes. Attempts to find statistical correlation between trace types, marking animal vital statistics, and sample collection protocol were unsuccessful. Mapping bite mark character states on a eusuchian phylogeny successfully predicted the presence of known diagnostic, bisected marks in extinct taxa. Predictions for clades that may have created multiple subscores, striated marks, and extensive crushing were also generated. Inclusion of fossil bite marks which have been positively associated with extinct species allow this method to be projected beyond the crown group. The results of this study indicate that phylogenies can and should be further explored for use as predictive tools in a taphonomic framework.},

Here, we review the opportunities presented by biodiversity time series, and address three related issues: (i) recognizing the characteristics of temporal data; (ii) selecting appropriate statistical procedures for analysing temporal data; and (iii) inferring and forecasting biodiversity change. With regard to the first issue, we draw attention to defining characteristics of biodiversity time series—lack of physical boundaries, uni-dimensionality, autocorrelation and directionality—that inform the choice of analytic methods. Second, we explore methods of quantifying change in biodiversity at different timescales, noting that autocorrelation can be viewed as a feature that sheds light on the underlying structure of temporal change. Finally, we address the transition from inferring to forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting potential pitfalls associated with phase-shifts and novel conditions.},

	abstract = {Modern and fossil ecological data exist at very different taxonomic, spatial, and temporal scales. For modern ecology, data are typically collected at the species-level, cover square meter quadrats to the entire globe, and span days to decades at most. For fossil assemblages, spatial scale might be comparable to that studied by modern ecologists, but fossil data are taxonomically and temporally much coarser (respectively, order-, family-, genus-level at best, and 104-108 years). Recent research has shown that ecological patterns and the processes affecting them change across scale. Therefore, using modern ecological theory and methods to study fossil data is an incommensurate exercise and potentially produces spurious results. Moreover, scale varies by orders of magnitude even among fossil assemblages, so comparing fossil sites without an appreciation of scale may also lead to ambiguous conclusions.
I argue that a disregard of scale within paleoanthropology has contributed to its inability to synthesize seemingly disparate paleoecological results into a coherent, unified framework. As a result, paleoanthropology has remained relatively stagnant regarding its understanding of how paleoecological processes drove hominin evolution. With this in mind, I adopt scale as a central theme in my dissertation and attempt to understand how ecological pattern and process change across modern and fossil scales in East African large mammal communities, and if these scale differences can be analytically reconciled.
The results from my three research chapters show ecological patterns (and the relevant processes driving them) fundamentally change across modern and fossil scales. Thus, modern and paleoecological theory and data are each incomplete: modern ecologists need to analyze fossil data if they want to study ecology at large time scales, and paleoecologists need to examine modern data and theory in order to understand smaller-scale processes; simple extrapolation and interpolation will not do. For paleoanthropologists, that means it is less than straightforward to infer smaller-scale ecological processes (e.g., paleoenvironmental reconstruction, interspecific interactions) from fossil assemblages, and caution should be exercised when attempting to do so. I by no means offer a panacea for this scale issue, but hopefully my research will make paleoanthropologists more cognizant of scale and encourage future research on this topic. Only then can we finally begin to understand what exactly were the important ecological drivers affecting hominin behavior and evolution.},

We developed an extension of N-mixture models to account for two commonly observed phenomena in point count surveys: rarity and lack of independence induced by unmeasurable sources of variation in the detectability of individuals. Rarity increases the number of locations with zero detections in excess of those expected under simple models of abundance (e.g., Poisson or negative binomial). Correlated behavior of individuals and other phenomena, though difficult to measure, increases the variation in detection probabilities among surveys. Our extension of N-mixture models includes a hurdle model of abundance and a beta-binomial model of detectability that accounts for additional (extra-binomial) sources of variation in detections among surveys. As an illustration, we fit this model to repeated point counts of the West Indian manatee, which was observed in a pilot study using aerial surveys. Our extension of N-mixture models provides increased flexibility. The effects of different sets of covariates may be estimated for the probability of occurrence of a species, for its mean abundance at occupied locations, and for its detectability.},

Three classes of mixture models (beta-binomial, logistic-normal, and latent-class) are fitted to recaptures of snowshoe hares for estimating abundance and to counts of bird species for estimating species richness. In both sets of data, rates of detection appear to vary more among individuals (animals or species) than among sampling occasions or locations. The estimates of population size and species richness are sensitive to model-specific assumptions about the latent distribution of individual rates of detection. We demonstrate using simulation experiments that conventional diagnostics for assessing model adequacy, such as deviance, cannot be relied on for selecting classes of mixture models that produce valid inferences about population size. Prior knowledge about sources of individual heterogeneity in detection rates, if available, should be used to help select among classes of mixture models that are to be used for inference.},

	abstract = {Aim Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co-occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. Approach: We present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Findings: Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species’ co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusions Moving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.},

	abstract = {The meat-eating behavior of Plio-Pleistocene hominids, responsible for the bone accumulations at the earliest archaeological sites, is still a hotly-debated issue in paleoanthropology. In particular, meat-eating and bone marrow consumption are often presented as either complementary or opposing strategies of carcass exploitation. The presence of cut marks on fossil archeofauna is a potential source of information that has not been consistently used as evidence of carcass consumption by hominids. Some authors interpret cut marks as the result of hominids manipulating meat-bearing bones, while others argue that they can also be the result of hominids extracting marginal scraps of carcass flesh that have survived carnivores’ initial consumption. In this study, a referential framework concerning the interpretation of cut marks is presented, based on a set of experiments conducted by the author. It is suggested, according to these experiments and data drawn from the FLK “Zinj” site, that hominids processed meat-bearing bones (on which flesh was abundant) rather than defleshed carcasses from felid kills.},

	abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘folk lore’-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

The analysis of paleoclimate archives encoding the environmental variability in East Africa during the past 5 Ma has triggered an ongoing debate about possible candidate processes and evolutionary mechanisms. In this work, we apply a nonlinear statistical technique, recurrence network analysis, to three distinct marine records of terrigenous dust flux. Our method enables us to identify three epochs with transitions between qualitatively different types of environmental variability in North and East Africa during the (i) Middle Pliocene (3.35–3.15 Ma B.P.), (ii) Early Pleistocene (2.25–1.6 Ma B.P.), and (iii) Middle Pleistocene (1.1–0.7 Ma B.P.). A deeper examination of these transition periods reveals potential climatic drivers, including (i) large-scale changes in ocean currents due to a spatial shift of the Indonesian throughflow in combination with an intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, (ii) a global reorganization of the atmospheric Walker circulation induced in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, and (iii) shifts in the dominating temporal variability pattern of glacial activity during the Middle Pleistocene, respectively. A reexamination of the available fossil record demonstrates statistically significant coincidences between the detected transition periods and major steps in hominin evolution. This result suggests that the observed shifts between more regular and more erratic environmental variability may have acted as a trigger for rapid change in the development of humankind in Africa.},

	abstract = {In this article, we explain an often overlooked process that may significantly contribute to positive correlations between measures of species diversity and community stability. Empirical studies showing positive stability‐diversity relationships have, for the most part, used a single class of stability (or, more accurately, instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate community properties such as biomass or productivity. We show that for these measures, stability will essentially always rise with species diversity because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate in the absence of any strong species interactions, although its strength is driven by the relative abundances of species, as well as by the existence of positive or negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To explore the possible importance of this effect in real communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical averaging might play a substantial role in explaining stability‐diversity correlations for this and other systems. Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful baseline for predictions of community stability, to which the influences of both negative and positive species interactions may then be added and tested.},

	abstract = {Species distribution model (SDM) projections under future climate scenarios are increasingly being used to inform resource management and conservation strategies. A critical assumption for projecting climate change responses is that SDMs are transferable through time, an assumption that is largely untested because investigators often lack temporally independent data for assessing transferability. Further, understanding how the ecology of species influences temporal transferability is critical yet almost wholly lacking. This raises two questions. (1) Are SDM projections transferable in time? (2) Does temporal transferability relate to species ecological traits? To address these questions we developed SDMs for 133 vascular plant species using data from the mountain ranges of California (USA) from two time periods: the 1930s and the present day. We forecast historical models over 75 years of measured climate change and assessed their projections against current distributions. Similarly, we hindcast contemporary models and compared their projections to historical data. We quantified transferability and related it to species ecological traits including physiognomy, endemism, dispersal capacity, fire adaptation, and commonness. We found that non?endemic species with greater dispersal capacity, intermediate levels of prevalence, and little fire adaptation had higher transferability than endemic species with limited dispersal capacity that rely on fire for reproduction. We demonstrate that variability in model performance was driven principally by differences among species as compared to model algorithms or time period of model calibration. Further, our results suggest that the traits correlated with prediction accuracy in a single time period may not be related to transferability between time periods. Our findings provide a priori guidance for the suitability of SDM as an approach for forecasting climate change responses for certain taxa.},

	abstract = {abstract: Evolutionary branching occurs when frequency‐dependent selection splits a phenotypically monomorphic population into two distinct phenotypic clusters. A prerequisite for evolutionary branching is that directional selection drives the population toward a fitness minimum in phenotype space. This article demonstrates that selection regimes leading to evolutionary branching readily arise from a wide variety of different ecological interactions within and between species. We use classical ecological models for symmetric and asymmetric competition, for mutualism, and for predator‐prey interactions to describe evolving populations with continuously varying characters. For these models, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching and establish that branching is a generic and robust phenomenon. Evolutionary branching becomes a model for sympatric speciation when population genetics and mating mechanisms are incorporated into ecological models. In sexual populations with random mating, the continual production of intermediate phenotypes from two incipient branches prevents evolutionary branching. In contrast, when mating is assortative for the ecological characters under study, evolutionary branching is possible in sexual populations and can lead to speciation. Therefore, we also study the evolution of assortative mating as a quantitative character. We show that evolution under branching conditions selects for assortativeness and thus allows sexual populations to escape from fitness minima. We conclude that evolutionary branching offers a general basis for understanding adaptive speciation and radiation under a wide range of different ecological conditions.},

	abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties,. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.},

	abstract = {Aim  To test the mechanisms driving bird species richness at broad spatial scales using eigenvector-based spatial filtering. Location  South America. Methods  An eigenvector-based spatial filtering was applied to evaluate spatial patterns in South American bird species richness, taking into account spatial autocorrelation in the data. The method consists of using the geographical coordinates of a region, based on eigenanalyses of geographical distances, to establish a set of spatial filters (eigenvectors) expressing the spatial structure of the region at different spatial scales. These filters can then be used as predictors in multiple and partial regression analyses, taking into account spatial autocorrelation. Autocorrelation in filters and in the regression residuals can be used as stopping rules to define which filters will be used in the analyses. Results  Environmental component alone explained 8\% of variation in richness, whereas 77\% of the variation could be attributed to an interaction between environment and geography expressed by the filters (which include mainly broad-scale climatic factors). Regression coefficients of environmental component were highest for AET. These results were unbiased by short-scale spatial autocorrelation. Also, there was a significant interaction between topographic heterogeneity and minimum temperature. Conclusion  Eigenvector-based spatial filtering is a simple and suitable statistical protocol that can be used to analyse patterns in species richness taking into account spatial autocorrelation at different spatial scales. The results for South American birds are consistent with the climatic hypothesis, in general, and energy hypothesis, in particular. Habitat heterogeneity also has a significant effect on variation in species richness in warm tropical regions.},

	abstract = {Despite the long-standing interest in nonstationarity of both phenotypic evolution and diversification rates, only recently have methods been developed to study this property. Here, we propose a methodological expansion of the phylogenetic signal-representation (PSR) curve based on phylogenetic eigenvectors to test for nonstationarity. The PSR curve is built by plotting the coefficients of determination R2 from phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) models increasing the number of phylogenetic eigenvectors against the accumulated eigenvalues. The PSR curve is linear under a stationary model of trait evolution (i.e. the Brownian motion model). Here we describe the distribution of shifts in the models R2 and used a randomization procedure to compare observed and simulated shifts along the PSR curve, which allowed detecting nonstationarity in trait evolution. As an applied example, we show that the main evolutionary pattern of variation in the theropod dinosaur skull was nonstationary, with a significant shift in evolutionary rates in derived oviraptorosaurs, an aberrant group of mostly toothless, crested, birdlike theropods. This result is also supported by a recently proposed Bayesian-based method (AUTEUR). A significant deviation between Ceratosaurus and Limusaurus terminal branches was also detected. We purport that our new approach is a valuable tool for evolutionary biologists, owing to its simplicity, flexibility and comprehensiveness.},

We studied 891 spatial replicates from the French Breeding Bird Survey (FBBS) monitored at least two years during 2001–2005, and two independent landscape databases measuring respectively landscape fragmentation and recent landscape disturbance on each FBBS replicate. We used a continuous habitat specialization index for the 105 most common bird species monitored by the FBBS. We further modelled the spatial variation in abundance of each species according to fragmentation and disturbance across FBBS replicates, accounting for habitat differences and spatial trends. We then tested whether more or less specialized species responded to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. We found that the more specialist a species, the more negative its spatial response to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. Although there was a very high variation around these tendencies indicating that there are many other drivers of species distribution, our results suggest that measuring specialization may be helpful in predicting which species are likely to thrive in human degraded landscapes. We also emphasize the need to consider both positive and negative species responses when assessing consequences of habitat change in communities.},

	abstract = {A simple dynamical community model mimics species interactions and produces, when it reaches equilibrium, a distribution of species abundances that is indistinguishable from the "J-curves" regularly seen by field biologists in samples and surveys. Analysis of the model reveals an equilibrium solution that is inverse linear in form. The theoretical distribution that results, here called the "logistic" distribution, is defined formally as the inverse linear function under a translation of axes which forms its two parameters. The initial hypothesis, that the resemblance between computer and natural abundance distributions is more than coincidental, has led to a near-cottage industry of new hypotheses, the three main ones being: 1. The logistic distribution describes abundance in natural communities. 2. The sampling process transforms a community abundance distribution into a sample abundance distribution by a scale transformation in both axes. 3. In natural communities a major influence on species abundance is the random (i.e., unpredictable) fluctuation in populations. This report describes the computer model, analysis of the model, and a brief summary of progress toward the establishment of Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 is susceptible of mathematical proof. It abolishes the idea of a "veil-line" as a sampling phenomenon. The third hypothesis is discussed briefly.},

Does this distribution represent a single formula operating behind the scenes, or does it represent several formulas, appropriate for different types of community? Or does it represent no particular formula at all?

However, this concept has become highly context-dependent and is now obscured by the great variability of existing definitions and methods used to characterize ecological specialization. 2.  In this study, we clarify this concept by reviewing the strengths and limitations of different approaches commonly used to define and measure ecological specialization. We first show that ecological specialization can either be considered as reflecting species’ requirements or species’ impacts. We then explain how specialization depends on species-specific characteristics and on local and contingent environmental constraints. We further show why and how ecological specialization should be scaled across spatial and temporal scales, and from individuals to communities. 3.  We then illustrate how this review can be used as a practical toolbox to classify widely used metrics of ecological specialization in applied ecology, depending on the question being addressed, the method used, and the data available. 4.
Synthesis and applications. Clarifying ecological specialization is useful to make explicit connections between several fields of ecology using the niche concept. Defining this concept and its practical metrics is also a crucial step to better formulate predictions of scientific interest in ecology and conservation. Finally, understanding the different facets of ecological specialization should facilitate to investigate the causes and consequences of biotic homogenization and to derive relevant indicators of biodiversity responses to land-use changes.},

Some principles of the theory are suggested and its potential for solving various problems and achieving various unifications is explored. These include providing a theory of information underlying classical and quantum information; generalising the theory of computation to include all physical transformations; unifying formal statements of conservation laws with the stronger operational ones (such as the ruling-out of perpetual motion machines); expressing the principles of testability and of the computability of nature (currently deemed methodological and metaphysical respectively) as laws of physics; allowing exact statements of emergent laws (such as the second law of thermodynamics); and expressing certain apparently anthropocentric attributes such as knowledge in physical terms.},

Within a landscape, a permanent migration of propagules or individuals from source to sink habitats may lead to a stabilization of the overall demographic system. This simple situation, explored in the recent literature, has surprising properties.

We propose a new method, based on the scalewise variance—that is, the variance as a function of spatial scale, calculated here with wavelet kernel functions—to disentangle the signature of processes that act at different and similar scales on observed spatial patterns. We derive exact and approximate analytical solutions for the expected scalewise variance under different individual-based, spatially explicit models for sessile organisms (e.g., plants), using moment equations. We further determine the probability distribution of independently observed scalewise variances for a given expectation, including complete spatial randomness. Thus, we provide a new analytical test of the null model of spatial randomness to understand at which scales, if any, the variance departs significantly from randomness. We also derive the likelihood function that is needed to estimate parameters of spatial models and their uncertainties from observed patterns. The methods are demonstrated through numerical examples and case studies of four tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The methods developed here constitute powerful new tools for investigating effects of ecological processes on spatial point patterns and for statistical inference of process models from spatial patterns.},

Preston in 1948 (Ecology29, 254–283). Instead, they follow a hypergeometric distribution, which has no resemblance to the veil line. There is therefore no justification for the truncation of distributions proposed to describe the abundances of species in natural communities. The mistake of the veil line points to the need for a general theory of sampling. If a community has a distributiongof species abundances and if samples taken of the community tend to follow distributionf, what is the relationship offtog? The seeds of such a theory are available in the work of E. C. Pielou. Using the Poisson distribution as a close approximation to the hypergeometric, one may immediately write and (in most cases) solve the transformation fromgtof. The transformation appears to preserve distribution formulas to within constants and parameters, providing yet another reason to rule out the use of truncation. Well beyond this application, the theory provides a foundation for rethinking the sampling process and its implications for ecology.},

	abstract = {Aim To relate variation in the migration capacity and colonization ability of island communities to island geography and species island occupancy. Location Islands off mainland Britain and Ireland. Methods Mean migration (transfer) capacity and colonization (establishment) ability (ecological indices), indexed from 12 ecological variables for 56 butterfly species living on 103 islands, were related to species nestedness, island and mainland source geography and indices using linear regression models, RLQ analysis and fourth-corner analysis. Random creation of faunas from source species, rank correlation and rank regression were used to examine differences between island and source ecological indices, and relationships to island geography. Results Island butterfly faunas are highly nested. The two ecological indices related closely to island occupancy, nestedness rank of species, island richness and geography. The key variables related to migration capacity were island area and isolation; for colonization ability they were area, isolation and longitude. Compared with colonization ability, migration capacity was found to correlate more strongly with island species occupancy and species richness. For island faunas, the means for both ecological indices decreased, and variation increased, with increasing island species richness. Mean colonization ability and migration capacity values were significantly higher for island faunas than for mainland source faunas, but these differences decreased with island latitude. Main conclusions The nested pattern of butterfly species on islands off mainland Britain and Ireland relates strongly to colonization ability but especially to migration capacity. Differences in colonization ability among species are most obvious for large, topographically varied islands. Generalists with abundant multiple resources and greater migration capacity are found on all islands, whereas specialists are restricted to large islands with varied and long-lived biotopes, and islands close to shore. The inference is that source–sink dynamics dominate butterfly distributions on British and Irish islands; species are capable of dispersing to new areas, but, with the exception of large and northern islands, facilities (resources) for permanent colonization are limited. The pattern of colonization ability and migration capacity is likely to be repeated for mainland areas, where such indices should provide useful independent measures for assessing the conservation status of faunas within spatial units.},

	abstract = {Mammals of numerous lineages have evolved high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth particularly during the last 20 million years. This major phenotypic change is one of the most widely studied evolutionary phenomena in a broad range of disciplines, though the mechanisms underlying its transformation remain unresolved. Here, we present the first Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate the alternative hypothesis that there is a biomechanical link between increased hypsodonty and a more effective mastication in deer. Our FE experiments compared patterns of stress and strain within and between different fossil and living species under different loading conditions, and found that more hypsodont teeth are suited for restricting stresses to those areas where chewing loading occurs. This mechanical improvement is consequence of specific and pronounced variations in tooth geometry and morphology of the occlusal surface that are strongly related to crown growth in the vertical plane. We demonstrate that hypsodonty enables selenodont-teeth to adopt a mechanically improved design that increases the pressure whilst shearing foods. As ruminants are physiologically limited by both the quantity of food consumed and the time spent in the mastication and digestion, hypsodonty is highly advantageous when feeding on mechanically resistant, tough and fibrous foods. Consequently, it allows grass-eaters to spend less time chewing, thereby increasing the volume of food ingested and/or providing more time for digestion. This study provides a promising line of evidences in support of biomechanical effectiveness, in addition to or instead of increased wear resistance, as a factor in explaining the evolutionary origins of the hypsodont phenotype.},

	abstract = {Aim  The aims of this study are to resolve terminological confusion around different types of species–area relationships (SARs) and their delimitation from species sampling relationships (SSRs), to provide a comprehensive overview of models and analytical methods for SARs, to evaluate these theoretically and empirically, and to suggest a more consistent approach for the treatment of species–area data. Location  Curonian Spit in north-west Russia and archipelagos world-wide. Methods  First, I review various typologies for SARs and SSRs as well as mathematical models, fitting procedures and goodness-of-fit measures applied to SARs. This results in a list of 23 function types, which are applicable both for untransformed (S) and for log-transformed (log S) species richness. Then, example data sets for nested plots in continuous vegetation (n = 14) and islands (n = 6) are fitted to a selection of 12 function types (linear, power, logarithmic, saturation, sigmoid) both for S and for log S. The suitability of these models is assessed with Akaike’s information criterion for S and log S, and with a newly proposed metric that addresses extrapolation capability. Results  SARs, which provide species numbers for different areas and have no upper asymptote, must be distinguished from SSRs, which approach the species richness of one single area asymptotically. Among SARs, nested plots in continuous ecosystems, non-nested plots in continuous ecosystems, and isolates can be distinguished. For the SARs of the empirical data sets, the normal and quadratic power functions as well as two of the sigmoid functions (Lomolino, cumulative beta-P) generally performed well. The normal power function (fitted for S) was particularly suitable for predicting richness values over ten-fold increases in area. Linear, logarithmic, convex saturation and logistic functions generally were inappropriate. However, the two sigmoid models produced unstable results with arbitrary parameter estimates, and the quadratic power function resulted in decreasing richness values for large areas. Main conclusions  Based on theoretical considerations and empirical results, I suggest that the power law should be used to describe and compare any type of SAR while at the same time testing whether the exponent z changes with spatial scale. In addition, one should be aware that power-law parameters are significantly influenced by methodology.},

The largest lake expansion event in the closed Olduvai lake basin during Bed I times encompassed the episode of eruption and emplacement of this tuff. This lake event is nearly coincident with the maximum precessional insolation peak of the entire Bed I/Lower Bed II interval, calculated from an astronomical model of the boreal summer orbital insolation time-series. The succeeding precessional peak also apparently coincides with the next youngest expansion of paleo-Lake Olduvai. The extreme wet/dry climate shifts seen in the upper part of Bed I occur during an Earth-orbital eccentricity maximum, similar to episodic lake expansions documented elsewhere in the East African Rift during the Neogene.},

Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber’s 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.},

	abstract = {Summary
Brain size represented by cranial capacity (CC) is one of the most frequently analysed characters of hominids. Accuracy of individual CC estimates depends on completeness of specimens and methods used for reconstruction and measurement. A file of published estimates of CC of hominids dated from 3.2 Ma (million years) to 10 Ka (thousand years) including 606 estimates for 243 specimens was compiled. In the file, 75 specimens are available with multiple values (3 to15) obtained by various methods and/or by various authors. Using individuals as classes in ANOVA, intraclass variation, which represents «error» of estimates, was calculated. For the total sample of multiple estimates (N = 382) the error variance is 5315 ml2. The error standard deviation is 73 ml (coefficient of variation (CV = 7.3\%), quite large in comparison to the actual variation in CC in modern humans, SD = 157 ml (CV = 11.6\%). This large error makes us wonder whether any fossil can be reliably placed with respect to a particular «cerebral Rubicon» between palaeospecies.

Recent discussions concerning cranial capacity of Stw505 are a case in point regarding errors in CC estimation. In actual repeated 30 time measurements on a research quality cast we obtained with various methods (water, seeds, plasticine) CC estimates ranging from 484 to 586 ml. The range of estimates in the literature is from 515 to 625 ml.

When hominid CC by taxon with date as a covariate is subjected to ANOVA, taxon is responsible for 5\% of the variance while date is responsible for the main portion, (89\%). The relationship between CC and date is best characterised as a gradual time trend. It is proven by the ANOVA test for linearity, by G test for trend and by ASReml fitting of a linear function. The line of best fit to this time trend is a double exponential curve which explains 90\% of the total variance in CC:

CC = 306.63 (4.830.9995DATE)

Essentially the same curve fits subsamples of CC dated at less than 1 Ma and at 3.21.0 Ma. This has several implications for the nature of the Darwinian process to be reconstructed.},

	abstract = {Aim  Although sharing many similarities in their vegetation types, South America and Africa harbour very dissimilar recent mammal faunas, not only taxonomically but also in terms of several faunistic patterns. However late Pleistocene and mid-Holocene faunas, albeit taxonomically distinct, presented many convergent attributes. Here we propose that the effects of the Holocene climatic change on vegetation physiognomy has played a crucial role in shaping the extant mammalian faunistic patterns. Location  South America and Africa from the late Pleistocene to the present. Methods  Data presented here have been compiled from many distinct sources, including palaeontological and neontological mammalian studies, palaeoclimatology, palynology, and publications on vegetation ecology. Data on Pleistocene, Holocene and extant mammal faunas of South America and Africa allowed us to establish a number of similar and dissimilar faunistic patterns between the two continents across time. We then considered what changes in vegetation physiognomy would have occurred under the late Pleistocene last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO) climatic regimes. We have ordained these proposed vegetation changes along rough physiognomic seral stages according to assumptions based on current botanical research. Finally, we have associated our hypothesized vegetation changes in South America and Africa with mammalian faunistic patterns, establishing a putative causal relationship between them. Results  The extant mammal faunas of South America and Africa differ widely in taxonomical composition; the number of medium and large species they possess; behavioural and ecological characteristics related to herbivore herding, migration and predation; and biogeographical patterns. All such distinctions are mostly related to the open formation faunas, and have been completely established around the mid-Holocene. Considering that the mid-Holocene was a time of greater humidity than the late Pleistocene, vegetation cover in South America and Africa would have been dominated by forest or closed vegetation landscapes, at least for most of their lower altitude tropical regions. We attribute the loss of larger-sized mammal lineages in South America to the decrease of open vegetation area, and their survival in Africa to the existence of vast savannas in formerly steppic or desertic areas in subtropical Africa, north and south of the equator. Alternative explanations, mostly dealing with the disappearance of South American megamammals, are then reviewed and criticized. Main conclusions  The reduction of open formation areas during the HCO in South America and Africa explains most of the present distinct faunistic patterns between the two continents. While South America would have lost most of its open formations within the 30° latitudinal belt, Africa would have kept large areas suitable to the open formation mammalian fauna in areas presently occupied by desert and semi-arid vegetation. Thus, the same general climatic events that affected South America in the late Pleistocene and Holocene also affected Africa, leading to our present day faunistic dissimilarities by maintaining the African mammalian communities almost unchanged while dramatically altering those of South America.},

About one-quarter of all mammals are in danger of extinction, and more than half of all mammal populations are in decline. A major priority for conservation science is to understand the ecological traits that predict extinction risk and the interactions among those predictors that make certain species more vulnerable than others. Here, using a new database of nearly 4,500 mammal species, we use decision-tree models to quantify the multiple interacting factors associated with extinction risk. We show that the correlates of extinction risk vary widely across mammals and that there are unique pathways to extinction for species with different lifestyles and combinations of traits. We find that risk is relative and that all kinds of mammals, across all body sizes, can be at risk depending on their specific ecologies. Our results increase the understanding of extinction processes, generate simple rules of thumb that identify species at greatest risk, and highlight the potential of decision-tree analyses to inform conservation efforts.},

Current evidence points to either energy availability or habitat heterogeneity as the most likely environmental drivers in terrestrial systems, but their relative importance is controversial in the absence of analyses of global (rather than continental or regional) extent. Here we use data on the global distribution of extant continental and continental island bird species to test the explanatory power of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing issues of spatial resolution, spatial autocorrelation, geometric constraints upon species' range dynamics, and the impact of human populations and historical glacial ice-cover. At the finest resolution (1°), topographical variability and temperature are identified as the most important global predictors of avian species richness in multi-predictor models. Topographical variability is most important in single-predictor models, followed by productive energy. Adjusting for null expectations based on geometric constraints on species richness improves overall model fit but has negligible impact on tests of environmental predictors. Conclusions concerning the relative importance of environmental predictors of species richness cannot be extrapolated from one biogeographic realm to others or the globe. Rather a global perspective confirms the primary importance of mountain ranges in high-energy areas.},

Spatial autocorrelation in species composition was determined using Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was applied to explore the influence of MEM variables and in-lake, and catchment environmental variables on Trichoptera assemblages. Variance partitioning analysis (partial RDA) revealed the fraction of species composition variation that could be attributed uniquely to either environmental variability or MEM variables. Finally, the distribution of individual species was analyzed in relation to specific environmental factors using binomial generalized linear models (GLM). Trichoptera assemblages showed spatial structure. However, the most relevant environmental variables in the RDA (i.e., temperature and woody vegetation in-lake catchments) were also related with spatial variables (i.e., altitude and longitude). Partial RDA revealed that the fraction of variation in species composition that was uniquely explained by environmental variability was larger than that uniquely explained by MEM variables. GLM results showed that the distribution of species with longitudinal bias is related to specific environmental factors with geographical trend. The environmental dependence found agrees with the particular traits of each species. We conclude that Trichoptera species distribution and composition in the lakes of the Pyrenees are governed predominantly by local environmental factors, rather than by dispersal constraints. For boreal lakes, with similar environmental conditions, a strong role of dispersal capacity has been suggested. Further investigation should address the role of spatial scaling, namely absolute geographical distances constraining dispersal and steepness of environmental gradients at short distances.},

	abstract = {Understanding which factors and rules govern the process of assembly in communities constitutes one of the main challenges of plant community ecology. The presence of certain functional strategies along broad environmental gradients can help to understand the patterns observed in community assembly and the filtering mechanisms that take place. We used a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in aboveground (leaf and stem) and belowground (root) functional traits along environmental gradients in Mediterranean forest communities (south Spain). We proposed a new practical method to quantify the relative importance of species turnover (distinguishing between species occurrence and abundance) versus intraspecific variation, which allowed us to better understand the assemblage rules of these plant communities along environmental gradients. Our results showed that the functional structure of the studied plant communities was highly determined by soil environment. Results from our modelling approach based on maximum likelihood estimators showed a predominant influence of soil water storage on most of the community functional traits. We found that changes in community functional structure along environmental gradients were mainly promoted by species turnover rather than by intraspecific variability. Specifically, our new method of variance decomposition demonstrated that between-site trait variation was the result of changes in species occurrence rather than in the abundance of certain dominant species. In conclusion, this study showed that water availability promoted the predominance of specific trait values (both in above and belowground fractions) associated to a resource acquisition or conservation strategy. In addition, we provided evidence that changes on community functional structure along the environmental gradient were mainly promoted by a process of species replacement, which represent a crucial step towards a more general understanding of the relative importance of intraspecific versus interspecific trait variation in these woody Mediterranean communities.

	abstract = {Global regressions of ecological population densities on body mass for mammals and for terrestrial animals as a whole show that local population energy-use is approximately independent of adult body mass—over a body mass range spanning more than 11 orders of magnitude. This independence is represented by the slope of the regressions approximating –0.75, the reciprocal of the way that individual metabolic requirements scale with body mass. The pattern still holds for mammalian primary consumers when the data are broken down by geographic area, by broad habitat-type and by individual community. Slopes for mammalian secondary consumers are also not statistically distinguishable from –0.75. For any given body mass temperate herbivores maintain on average population densities of 1.5 to 2.0 times those of tropical ones, though slopes do not differ. Terrestrial animals of all sizes exhibit approximately the same range of population energy-use values. These results agree with those reported for population energy-budgets. It is suggested that rough independence of body mass and the energy-use of local populations is a widespread rule of animal ecology and community structure.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 55.8 Ma), an abrupt global warming event linked to a transient increase in pCO2, was comparable in rate and magnitude to modern anthropogenic climate change. Here we use plant fossils from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming to document the combined effects of temperature and pCO2 on insect herbivory. We examined 5,062 fossil leaves from five sites positioned before, during, and after the PETM (59–55.2 Ma). The amount and diversity of insect damage on angiosperm leaves, as well as the relative abundance of specialized damage, correlate with rising and falling temperature. All reach distinct maxima during the PETM, and every PETM plant species is extensively damaged and colonized by specialized herbivores. Our study suggests that increased insect herbivory is likely to be a net long-term effect of anthropogenic pCO2 increase and warming temperatures.},

	abstract = {1.Biotic regionalization provides fundamental information for biogeography and conservation. The current consensus is to couple turnover indices and clustering methods to identify regions with distinct biotic composition. Nevertheless, turnover indices can produce large numbers of zero and tied dissimilarity values generating multiple clustering solutions which vary according to the arbitrary order of cases in the input matrix. Zero and tied values are particularly numerous at mid-small spatial scales where low signals for turnover occur. Turnover patterns can be also obscured by incomplete sampling. 2.We have designed a new method (recluster.region) based on the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix involving a continuous consensus of cell clustering among different random trees. This matrix minimizes the bias produced by zero and tied values before the final clustering. We created virtual datasets with a priori generated turnover areas and compared the power of the new and of classic methods in recognizing regionalization patterns on the basis of several evaluators (consistency amongst runs, correct attribution, mean silhouette width and explained dissimilarity) for different levels of sampling intensity (collection completeness). We also used a real dataset of British butterflies recorded for 10×10 km2 cells to test our method. 3.All methods were sensitive to the order of cases in the dissimilarity matrix. Some methods (UPGMA, UPGMC, WPGMA, WPGMC and single linkage) also produced ineffective clustering solutions. Our recluster.region procedures had higher consistency compared to classic clustering and performed best in recognising the a priori determined regions in virtual datasets (mostly when in association with Ward clustering). Moreover, for the real butterfly dataset, recluster.region associated with Ward method and to a lesser extent with DIANA and complete linkage, resulted in stable solutions, which largely agreed with the distribution of a set of species identified as responsible for generating the turnover pattern. The Ward method also performed best with low collection completeness. 4.Regionalization can be greatly improved by using the recluster.region algorithm. For the butterflies dataset it clearly revealed the occurrence of three faunistic regions, supporting the existence of a Holocene climatic refuge and a current Anthropocene refuge in northern and western Britain.

	abstract = {The statistical framework of rarefaction curves and asymptotic estimators allows for an effective standardization of biodiversity measures. However, most statistical analyses still consist of point comparisons of diversity estimators for a particular sampling level. We introduce new randomization methods that incorporate sampling variability encompassing the entire length of the rarefaction curve and allow for statistical comparison of i ≥2 individual-based, sample-based, or coverage-based rarefaction curves. These methods distinguish between two distinct null hypotheses: the ecological null hypothesis (H0eco) and the biogeographical null hypothesis (H0biog). H0eco states that the i samples were drawn from a single assemblage, and any differences among them in species richness, composition, or relative abundance reflect only sampling effects. H0biog states that the i samples were drawn from assemblages that differ in their species composition but share similar species richness and species abundance distributions. To test H0eco, we created a composite rarefaction curve by summing the abundances of all species from the i samples. We then calculated a test statistic Zeco, the (cumulative) summed areas of difference between each of the i individual curves and the composite curve. For H0biog, the test statistic Zbiog was calculated by summing the area of difference between all possible pairs of the i individual curves. Bootstrap sampling from the composite curve (H0eco) or random sampling from different simulated assemblages using alternative abundance distributions (H0biog) was used to create the null distribution of Z, and to provide a frequentist test of Z {\textbar} H0. Rejection of H0eco does not pinpoint whether the samples differ in species richness, species composition, and/or relative abundance. In benchmark comparisons, both tests performed satisfactorily against artificial data sets randomly drawn from a single assemblage (low Type I error). In benchmark comparisons with different species abundance distributions and richness, the tests had adequate power to detect differences among curves (low Type II error), although power diminished at small sample sizes and for small differences among underlying species rank abundances.},

	abstract = {* 1Ecologically significant evolutionary change, occurring over tens of generations or fewer, is now widely documented in nature. These findings counter the long-standing assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur on different time-scales, and thus that the study of ecological processes can safely assume evolutionary stasis. Recognition that substantial evolution occurs on ecological time-scales dissolves this dichotomy and provides new opportunities for integrative approaches to pressing questions in many fields of biology.
* 2The goals of this special feature are twofold: to consider the factors that influence evolution on ecological time-scales – phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, sexual selection, and gene flow – and to assess the consequences of such evolution – for population persistence, speciation, community dynamics, and ecosystem function.
* 3The role of evolution in ecological processes is expected to be largest for traits that change most quickly and for traits that most strongly influence ecological interactions. Understanding this fine-scale interplay of ecological and evolutionary factors will require a new class of eco-evolutionary dynamic modelling.
* 4Contemporary evolution occurs in a wide diversity of ecological contexts, but appears to be especially common in response to anthropogenic changes in selection and population structure. Evolutionary biology may thus offer substantial insight to many conservation issues arising from global change.
* 5Recent studies suggest that fluctuating selection and associated periods of contemporary evolution are the norm rather than exception throughout the history of life on earth. The consequences of contemporary evolution for population dynamics and ecological interactions are likely ubiquitous in time and space.},

Herein, we tackled on this issue by studying late Quaternary large mammal paleocommunities of Eurasia. The late Quaternary was a period of strong environmental instability, especially characterized by the occurrence of the last glacial maximum (LGM). We used community phylogenetics and joint species distribution models in order to understand the factors determining paleocommunity composition in the late Quaternary. Our results support the existence of strong climatic selection operating on the LGM fauna, both through the disappearance of warm-adapted species such as Elephas antiquus, Hippopothamus amphibious, and Stephanorhinus hemitoechus, and by setting the stage for the existence of a community characterized by cold-adapted large mammals. Patterns of abundance in the fossil record, co-occurrence between species pairs, and the extent of climatic forcing on faunal composition, differ between paleocommunities, but not between extinct and extant species, which is consistent with the idea that climate change, rather than the presence of humans, exerted a major effect on the survival of the late Quaternary megafauna.},

Despite this diversity, most terrestrial carnivores can be classified as either feeding on invertebrates and small vertebrates or on large vertebrates. Small carnivores feed predominantly on invertebrates probably because they are a superabundant resource (sometimes 90\% of animal biomass1,2,3); however, intake rates of invertebrate feeders are low, about one tenth of those of vertebrate feeders4,5. Although small carnivores can subsist on this diet because of low absolute energy requirements, invertebrate feeding appears to be unsustainable for larger carnivores. Here we show, by reviewing the most common live prey in carnivore diets, that there is a striking transition from feeding on small prey (less than half of predator mass) to large prey (near predator mass), occurring at predator masses of 21.5–25 kg. We test the hypothesis that this dichotomy is the consequence of mass-related energetic requirements and we determine the predicted maximum mass that an invertebrate diet can sustain. Using a simple energetic model and known invertebrate intake rates, we predict a maximum sustainable mass of 21.5 kg, which matches the point where predators shift from small to large prey.},

Studies that statistically evaluate potential factors affecting paleodiversity have focused on continental and global, clade-wide datasets, and thus we ignore how community species richness build-up to generate large-scale patterns over geological timescales. If community diversity is shaped by biotic interactions and continental and global diversities are governed by abiotic events, which are the modulators of diversity in subcontinental regions? To address this question, we model Iberian mammalian species richness over 13 million years (15 to 2 Ma) using exhaustive fossil evidence for subcontinental species’ ecomorphology, environmental context, and biogeographic affinities, and quantitatively evaluate their impact on species richness. We find that the diversity of large Iberian mammals has been limited over time, with species richness showing marked fluctuations, undergoing substantial depletions as diversity surpasses a critical limit where a significant part of the niches is unviable. The strength of such diversity-dependence has also shifted. Large faunal dispersals and environmental heterogeneity increased the system’s critical diversity limit. Diversity growth rate (net migration and diversification) also oscillated, mainly modulated by functional saturation, patchiness of canopy cover, and local temperature and aridity. Our study provides quantitative support for subcontinental species pools being complex and dynamic systems where diversity is perpetually imbalanced over geological timescales. Subcontinental diversity-dependence dynamics are mainly modulated by a multi-scale interplay of biotic and abiotic factors, with abiotic factors playing a more relevant role.},

	abstract = {Comparisons of species composition among isolated ecological communities of different size have often provided evidence that the species in communities with lower species richness form nested subsets of the species in larger communities. In the vast majority of studies, the question of nested subsets has been addressed using information on presence-absence, where a “0” is interpreted as the absence of a given species from a given location. Most of the methodological discussion in earlier studies investigating nestedness concerns the approach to generation of model-based matrices corresponding to the null hypothesis of a nonnested pattern. However, it is most likely that in many situations investigators cannot detect all the species present in the location sampled. The possibility that zeros in incidence matrices reflect nondetection rather than absence of species has not been considered in studies addressing nested subsets, even though the position of zeros in these matrices forms the basis of earlier inference methods. These sampling artifacts are likely to lead to erroneous conclusions about both variation over space in species richness, and the degree of similarity of the various locations. Here we propose an approach to investigation of nestedness, based on statistical inference methods explicitly incorporating species detection probability, that take into account the probabilistic nature of the sampling process. We use presence-absence data collected under Pollock's robust capture-recapture design, and resort to an estimator of species richness originally developed for closed populations to assess the proportion of species shared by different locations. We develop testable predictions corresponding to the null hypothesis of a nonnested pattern, and an alternative hypothesis of perfect nestedness. We also present an index for assessing the degree of nestedness of a system of ecological communities. We illustrate our approach using avian data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey collected in Florida Keys.},

	abstract = {The Pliocene Hadar Formation (Ethiopia) preserves a rich geological and paleontological record germane to our understanding of early hominin evolution. At the Hadar Research Project area, {\textasciitilde}155 m of Hadar Formation strata span the interval from ca. 3.45 to 2.90 Ma and consist of floodplain paleosols (dominantly Vertisols), fluvial and deltaic sands, and both pedogenically modified and unmodified lacustrine clays and silts. Clays and silts constitute the majority of the Hadar sediments. In the absence of clear lacustrine indicators, most of these fine-grained sediments are interpreted as fluvial floodplain or delta-plain deposits that exhibit varying degrees of pedogenic modification. Lacustrine and lake-margin deposits are represented by laminated mudstones, gastropod coquinas, limestones, and certain pedogenically modified and unmodified strata preserving gastropods, ostracods, and aquatic vertebrate remains. Most sands can be attributed to channel and point-bar deposits of a large-scale meandering river system or associated crevasse-splay and distributary-channel deposits.Fluvial-deltaic deposition predominated at Hadar. The lacustrine depocenter was located east and northeast of Hadar, but lacustrine transgressions into the region were a regular occurrence. Evidence presented here suggests that during lacustrine-dominated intervals, lake water depths at Hadar were most likely relatively shallow and included repeated regression events across a low-gradient shoreline. Vertebrate remains at Hadar are disproportionately recovered from fluvial and deltaic sands and silts. This is most likely a taphonomic effect related to the low preservation potential of bones in Vertisols, which are common at Hadar, as opposed to their original distribution across the paleolandscape.},

	abstract = {The Hadar paleoanthropological site in Ethiopia preserves a record of hominin evolution spanning from approximately 3.45 Ma to 0.8 Ma. An angular unconformity just above the ca. 2.95 Ma BKT-2 complex divides the sediments into the Hadar Formation (ca. 3.8–2.9 Ma) and the Busidima Formation (ca. 2.7–0.15 Ma). The unconformity is likely a response to a major tectonic reorganization in the Afar Depression, and activation of the As Duma fault near the Ethiopian Escarpment (west of Hadar) created a half-graben in which the Busidima Formation was deposited. The pattern and character of sedimentation in the region changed dramatically above the unconformity, as cut-and-fill channel conglomerates and silt-dominated paleosols that comprise the Busidima Formation stand in sharp contrast to the underlying deposits of the Hadar Formation. Conglomerate deposition has been related to both the perennial, axial paleo-Awash and ephemeral, escarpment-draining tributaries. Overbank silts have yielded fossils attributed to early Homo and Oldowan stone tools. Numerous tuffaceous deposits exist within the Busidima Formation, but they are often spatially limited, fine-grained, and reworked. Recent work on the tephrostratigraphic framework of the Busidima Formation at Hadar has identified at least 12 distinct vitric tephras and established the first geochemical-based correlations between Hadar and the neighboring project areas of Gona and Dikika. Compared to Gona and Dikika, where Busidima Formation sediments are exposed over large areas, the highly discontinuous sediments at Hadar comprise less than 40 m in composite section and are exposed over an area of \&lt;20 km2, providing only snapshots into the 2.7–0.15 Ma window. The stratigraphic record at Hadar confirms the complex depositional history of the Busidima Formation, and also provides important details on regional stratigraphic correlations and the pattern of deposition and erosion in the lower Awash Valley reflective of its tectonic history.},

We developed a model in which the increase in observed species richness is a function of sampling effort exclusively. We assumed that effort depends on area sampled, and we generated species–area curves under that model. These curves can be realistic looking. We then generated SARs from avian data, comparing SARs based on counts with those based on richness estimates. We used an approach to estimation of species richness that accounts for species detection probability and, hence, for variation in sampling effort. The slopes of SARs based on counts are steeper than those of curves based on estimates of richness, indicating that the former partly reflect failure to account for species detection probability. SARs based on estimates reflect ecological processes exclusively, not sampling processes. This approach permits investigation of ecologically relevant hypotheses. The slope of SARs is not influenced by the slope of the relationship between habitat diversity and area. In situations in which not all of the species are detected during sampling sessions, approaches to estimation of species richness integrating species detection probability should be used to investigate the rate of increase in species richness with area.},

	abstract = {The impact of the theory of punctuated equilibria on anthropology is restricted to physical anthropology because, contrary to the situation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, evolutionary theory now affects only this subdiscipline of anthropology. The major impact of punctuated equilibria theory occurs in palaeoanthropology. Here it affects discussion of rates of evolution, species discrimination in the fossil record, and species longevity and stasis. The principal palaeontological approach to species is to define them by morphological differences. This is a typological interpretation of species, because unvarying types are examined. Hence species are found to be separated by unbridgeable gaps, and the speciation event itself is all important. Emphasis on the speciation event explains why so many adherents of punctuated equilibria are also cladists. The strictly dichotomous branching of lineages and concomitant extinction of the ancestral species which occurs in cladistic analysis also emphasizes speciation. The generation and study of cladograms have become all important in palaeoanthropology, and the biology and adaptations of ancient hominids have been denigrated. Phyletic lines are dealt with as if they are the units of evolution, and not populations, as can be seen in a number of recent studies of Plio/Pleistocene hominids. Population thinking had been introduced into physical anthropology in 1951, and had caused the disappearance of both the degree of difference criterion for species and schemes of static human categories. Studies of fossil and living hominids were transformed. If studies of hominid adaptation and biology originate in the demise of typological thinking, they are endangered by the reintroduction of typological thinking by adherents of punctuated equilibria. Hominids are analysed in terms of migration and gene flow, and not in terms of adaptation to changing forces of natural selection and local population transformation in situ. Hence, for both fossil and living hominids, punctuated equilibria theory reintroduces catastrophism as an explanation for change. Some adherents of punctuated equilibria have denigrated sociobiology as a quest for generalizations about behavioral evolution among unnatural (non-cladistic, hence non-evolutionary) groupings of organisms not descended from a common ancestor, This may affect physical anthropologists who analyse human and non-human primate or mammalian behaviour and ecology from a sociobiological perspective. Archaeology is still another subdiscipline of anthropology which may be influenced by punctuated equilibria theory, although this is less certainly seen than in physical anthropology. It has been claimed, for example, that the archaeological record shows long periods of stasis and sudden, rapid bursts of change in stone tool industries, which is the principal evidence of behavioral evolution throughout most of hominid existence. Similar claims have been made for Egyptian cultural history. Archaeologists, however, have not accepted these generalizations. Yet one area in which punctuated equilibria theory does seem to have influenced archaeological interpretation lies in the analysis of Pleistocene and Holocene extinctions. Here the argument is that humans may have directly or indirectly contributed to the extinction of many animal species, perhaps in a catastrophic fashion.},

Near the 1·64 million year old stratigraphic level of the Okote Tuff complex, stone raw materials and tools are abundant in fluvial contexts at the Karari Ridge. In contrast, hominid fossils are abundant but stone raw materials are absent and tools are rare in fluvial and shallow, ephemeral lake margin contexts at Ileret and at the Koobi Fora Ridge. As the distance to the nearest source of stone raw materials increases, from local abundance at the Karari Ridge to 5 km at Ileret and to at least 15 km at the Koobi Fora Ridge, the archaeological visibility of hominid activities, as defined by sites with stone tools, decreases to essentially zero. Cut marks made with large stone tools during Butchery occur on more than 66 fossil bones from Ileret and especially from the Koobi Fora Ridge. In the absence of associated stone tools, those define a new kind of stone age site. The fossils with cut marks represent diverse skeletal parts and taxa, especially hippopotamus, and occur over several square km as isolated specimens, as associated elements of one carcass, and as concentrations of conjoining pieces and multiple carcasses. Some of the defleshing cut marks occur on intact limb elements that were not utilized for marrow. Early Homo erectus probably carried large stone tools during their foraging visits to these sub-regions, using the tools in butchery but rarely discarding them. Alternative hominid foraging strategies along the ancestral Omo River and taphonomic processes of site formation are discussed.},

We clarify conceptually and through examples from marine and terrestrial environments how facilitation can expand species’ niches and consider how these interactions can be scaled up to understand the importance of facilitation in setting a species’ geographic range. We then integrate the niche-broadening influence of facilitation into current conceptual areas in ecology, including climate change, diversity maintenance and the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. 3. Because facilitation can influence the range of physical conditions under which a species can persist, it has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change on species distributions. Whereas facilitation has mostly been considered as a diversity promoting interaction by ameliorating abiotic stresses, if facilitated species’ niches expand and become less distinct as a result of habitat amelioration, the forces that maintain diversity and promote coexistence in regions or habitats dominated by the facilitator could be reduced (i.e., the sign of the effects of facilitation on populations could be species-specific). Finally, shifting or broadening ecological niches could alter the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. 4. A niche-based perspective on the effects of facilitation can foster a greater mechanistic understanding of the role played by facilitation in regulating species coexistence, range shifts, and ecosystem functioning in a changing world.

Does this variation reflect how food requirements differ between trophic levels (herbivores vs. carnivores) and with taxonomic affiliation (mammals and birds vs. reptiles)? We gathered data on the body size and food requirements of the top terrestrial herbivores and carnivores, over the past 65,000 years, from oceanic islands and continents. The body mass of the top species was found to increase with increasing land area, with a slope similar to that of the relation between body mass and home range area, suggesting that maximum body size is determined by the number of home ranges that can fit into a given land area. For a given land area, the body size of the top species decreased in the sequence: ectothermic herbivore {\textgreater} endothermic herbivore {\textgreater} ectothermic carnivore {\textgreater} endothermic carnivore. When we converted body mass to food requirements, the food consumption of a top herbivore was about 8 times that of a top carnivore, in accord with the factor expected from the trophic pyramid. Although top ectotherms were heavier than top endotherms at a given trophic level, lower metabolic rates per gram of body mass in ectotherms resulted in endotherms and ectotherms having the same food consumption. These patterns explain the size of the largest-ever extinct mammal, but the size of the largest dinosaurs exceeds that predicted from land areas and remains unexplained.},

Both species are characterized by greater brain size, increased body height and smaller teeth relative to Pliocene Australopithecus in Africa. Here we report the discovery, from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia, of an adult hominin with stature and endocranial volume approximating 1 m and 380 cm3, respectively—equal to the smallest-known australopithecines. The combination of primitive and derived features assigns this hominin to a new species, Homo floresiensis. The most likely explanation for its existence on Flores is long-term isolation, with subsequent endemic dwarfing, of an ancestral H. erectus population. Importantly, H. floresiensis shows that the genus Homo is morphologically more varied and flexible in its adaptive responses than previously thought.},

	abstract = {The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology, or METE, is a theoretical framework of macroecology that makes a variety of realistic ecological predictions about how species richness, abundance of species, metabolic rate distributions, and spatial aggregation of species interrelate in a given region. In the METE framework, "ecological state variables" (representing total area, total species richness, total abundance, and total metabolic energy) describe macroecological properties of an ecosystem. METE incorporates these state variables into constraints on underlying probability distributions. The method of Lagrange multipliers and maximization of information entropy (MaxEnt) lead to predicted functional forms of distributions of interest. We demonstrate how information entropy is maximized for the general case of a distribution, which has empirical information that provides constraints on the overall predictions. We then show how METE’s two core functions are derived. These 
functions, called the "Spatial Structure Function" and the "Ecosystem Structure Function" are the core pieces of the theory, from which all the predictions of METE follow (including the Species Area Distribution, the Species Abundance Distribution, and various metabolic distributions). Primarily, we consider the discrete distributions predicted by METE.We also explore the parameter space defined by the METE’s state variables and Lagrange multipliers. We aim to provide a comprehensive resource for ecologists who want to understand the derivations and assumptions of basic mathematical structure of METE.},

Here, we quantify such spatial and seasonal variations based on extensive empirical data and present the first global biogeography of key traits (body size, feeding mode, relative offspring size and myelination) for pelagic copepods, the major group of marine zooplankton. We identify strong patterns with latitude, season and between ocean basins that are partially (c. 50\%) explained by key environmental drivers. Body size, for example decreases with temperature, confirming the temperature-size rule, but surprisingly also with productivity, possibly driven by food-chain length and size-selective predation. Patterns unrelated to environmental predictors may originate from phylogenetic clustering. Our maps can be used as a test-bed for trait-based mechanistic models and to inspire next-generation biogeochemical models.},

This paper focused attention on problems of species diversity and community organization that have occupied many theoretical and empirical ecologists for the last two decades. In the present paper I evaluate the attempt to answer Hutchinson's question by considering three topics. First, I reexamine the main themes which Hutchinson developed in "The Homage" and call attention to the central importance of energetic relationships in his view of ecological communities. Second, I examine the development of theoretical community ecology over the last two decades in an attempt to determine why some avenues of investigation, such as competition theory, have proven disappointing, whereas others, such as the theory of island biogeography, have enjoyed at least modest success. Finally, I suggest that future attempts to understand patterns of species diversity might focus on developing two kinds of theoretical constructs: capacity rules, which describe how characteristics of the physical environment determine its capacity to support life, and allocation rules, which describe how limited energetic resources are subdivided among species.},

These tuffs have recently been shown to be 1.87 ± 0.02 Ma and 1.38 ± 0.03 Ma in age, respectively. The sequence of tuffs that is derived is consistent with 40Ar/39Ar ages reported separately, and provides the stratigraphic framework for interpreting those ages. Further, new correlations are established to the Konso Formation in southern Ethiopia. As drainage from the Ethiopian Rift to the Omo–Turkana Basin developed after deposition of the Konso Formation, pumice clasts in tuffs of the Omo–Turkana Basin probably were transported there by the Omo River. The tuffs are divided into five groups on the basis of their stratigraphic position in relation to extensive ash layers. The sequence of tuffs has import for the placement and age of archaeological sites in the Koobi Fora Formation, and for ages of mammalian faunas (including hominids). Many tuffs were deposited during a 90 ka interval during which Mediterranean sapropels are lacking, suggesting that Nile flow was reduced, and that the level of a lake that occupied the Omo–Turkana Basin at the time was low. Thus the record of climatic influence on deposition in the Omo–Turkana Basin, previously shown for the Kibish Formation (≤200 ka), extends at least to early Pleistocene time.},

The faunal assemblages derive from two main fossil bearing regions (northerly localities near the town of Karonga, and more southerly localities near the village of Uraha) within the Malawi Rift. These assemblages date from somewhat older than 4·0 Ma to less than 1·6 Ma based on biochronological comparisons to radiometrically dated biostratigraphic horizons in eastern Africa. Comparisons between the Chiwondo Beds fauna and endemic Plio-Pleistocene faunas of eastern and southern Africa indicate that the Malawi Rift belongs largely within the paleoecological domain of eastern Africa, though it also records the northernmost transgressions of several southern African endemic taxa. Continental position and climatic conditions responsible for the tropical/temperate zonation in Africa are suggested to partly account for the large mammal barrier in the vicinity, of the Zambezian Ecozone today. However, faunal dispersion from southern to eastern Africa dominates after 2·5 Ma suggesting that this zonation drifted equator-ward during Late Pliocene climate change in accordance with the "Habitat Theory" of Vrba (1992). Interpretation of the Chiwondo Beds faunal assemblage has potential implications for the presumed dates of first appearance in southern African Pliocene assemblages, and may further contribute ecological criteria to scenarios of faunal phylogenesis.},

	abstract = {*
An important problem encountered by ecologists in species distribution modelling (SDM) and in multivariate analysis is that of understanding why environmental responses differ across species, and how differences are mediated by functional traits.



*
We describe a simple, generic approach to this problem – the core idea being to fit a predictive model for species abundance (or presence/absence) as a function of environmental variables, species traits and their interaction.



*
We show that this method can be understood as a model-based approach to the fourth-corner problem – the problem of studying the environment–trait association using matrices of abundance or presence/absence data across species, environmental data across sites and trait data across species. The matrix of environment–trait interaction coefficients is the fourth corner.



*
We illustrate that compared with existing approaches to the fourth-corner problem, the proposed model-based approach has advantages in interpretability and its capacity to perform model selection and make predictions.



*
To illustrate the method we used a generalized linear model with a LASSO penalty, fitted to data sets from four different studies requiring different models, illustrating the flexibility of the proposed approach.



*
Predictive performance of the model is compared with that of fitting SDMs separately to each species, and in each case, it is shown that the trait model, despite being much simpler, had comparable predictive performance, even significantly outperforming separate SDMs in some cases.},

	abstract = {The Hominid Corridor Research Project has recovered a mandibular corpus, UR 501, containing third and fourth premolars and first and second molars in variable states of preservation, from Late Pliocene paleolake Malawi sediments at Uraha in northern Malawi. A qualitative description is accompanied by quantitative measures of the corpus, tooth crowds and roots, and enamel microanatomical features. Many absolute and relative measures respecting molar and premolar crown shape indices, some relative cusp areas, and enamel microanatomical features, as well as fissure patterns and crown morphology, are within the sample range of early Homo, though some are within the limits of variation represented by Australopithecus (A. africanus and A. afarensis ). However, UR 501 has absolutely large molar crown areas, P3 relative expansion of the talonid, plate-like P3 and P4 roots, and some enamel microanatomical features that correspond more closely to the Paranthropus condition. Taken altogether, UR 501 corresponds closely to the subset of Late Pliocene fossils from east of Lake Turkana, Kenya, that have relatively large brains and robust jaws and teeth and that have been referred to Homo rudolfensis Alexeev, 1986, by Wood (1992b), and to which we also refer UR 501. Faunas that are both associated with UR 501 and provide some biochronological control indicate a date between 2·5 and 2·3 Ma.

The palaeobiogeographic significance of UR 501 lay in its association with an assemblage dominated by eastern African endemic taxa. We provide the palaeobiogeographic implications of the Chiwondo Beds faunal assemblages (cf. Bromage et al., 1995) to suggest that Homo rudolfensis arose in eastern Africa during, and partly as a result of, the ca. 2·5 Ma climatic cooling event. It remained endemic there while southern African taxa were dispersing toward the equator. The pattern to emerge from our paleobiogeographic perspectives on other hominid taxa is that early hominids arose successively in the eastern African tropical ecological domain. During favorable periods, some early hominids dispersed southward beyond the Zambesian Ecozone, evolved there, perhaps due to relative isolation and/or due to factors associated with its temperate ecology, and became endemic there.},

	abstract = {1. In community and population ecology, there is a chronic gap between the classic Eltonian ecology describing patterns in abundance and body mass across species and ecosystems and the more process oriented foraging ecology addressing interactions and quantitative population dynamics. However, this dichotomy is arbitrary, because body mass also determines most species traits affecting foraging interactions and population dynamics. 2. In this review, allometric (body-mass dependent) scaling of handling times and attack rates are documented, whereas body-mass effects on Hill exponents (varying between hyperbolic type II and sigmoid type III functional responses) and predator interference coefficients are lacking. This review describes how these allometric relationships define a biological plausible parameter space for population dynamic models. 3. Consistent with the classic Eltonian description, species co-existence in consumer-resource models and tri-trophic food chains is restricted to intermediate consumer-resource body-mass ratios. Allometric population dynamic models allow understanding the processes of energy limitation and unstable dynamics leading to this restriction. Complex food webs are stabilized by high predator-prey body-mass ratios, which are consistent with those found in natural ecosystems. These high body-mass ratios yield positive diversity-stability and complexity-stability relationships thus supporting the classic picture of ecosystem stability. 4. Allometric-trophic network models, based on body mass and trophic information from ecosystems, bridge the gap between Eltonian community patterns and process-oriented foraging ecology and provide a new means to describe the dynamics and functioning of natural ecosystems.},

This communication provides a thorough interpretation of the external anatomical landmarks observable on Sm 3. Using computer tomography (CT) and traditional morphological measurements, our comparative paleoneurological analyses show that while Sm 3 has a mosaic of features that are similar to both Indonesian and Chinese H. erectus, it also possesses significant characters reminiscent of later hominins. These include a greater degree of asymmetry characterized by a possible left-occipital, right-frontal petalial pattern, left-right volumetric cerebral asymmetry, and marked asymmetry in Broca's cap. Moreover, the frontal lobe offers a more rounded, shortened appearance in contrast to the flat, elongated appearance of other Indonesian fossils (e.g., Sangiran 17). Another unique trait is exhibited in the transverse plane where the widest breadth of Sm 3 occurs more superiorly than in other Indonesian H. erectus. Thus, the endocast of Sm 3 presents a unique morphology not seen previously in the hominin fossil record. While the strong modern human characteristics in this endocast may not represent a particular ancestry, they do allow us to recognize a new dimension of the remarkable variation in Indonesian Homo erectus.

	abstract = {Many plants interact with groups of mutualist pollinators and seed dispersers. A key issue for both basic ecology and conservation is whether the different species within these guilds of mutualist animals are functionally equivalent. Comparing the relative effects of sympatric mutualists is important for understanding the evolution of multispecies mutualisms and for predicting mutualism stability in the face of anthropogenic change. However, empirical comparisons of the population-level impacts of mutualist animals on their host plant are rare, particularly for seed dispersal mutualisms in species-rich ecosystems. We compared the influence of three seed-dispersing tropical mammals, lar gibbons (Hylobates lar), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and red muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak), on the demography of a shared host tree in Thailand, Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae). Sambar and muntjac dispersed far more C. axillaris seeds than did gibbons. While sambar deposited many seeds under female tree canopies, muntjac were the only disperser to move seeds to open microhabitats, where C. axillaris seed germination, seedling survival, and initial growth are enhanced. Using stage-based population models, we assessed how disperser-specific seed dispersal, variation in the frequency of canopy gap formation, and their interaction influenced the potential population growth of C. axillaris. Large differences in dispersal quantity and small differences in dispersal quality among sambar and gibbons resulted in similar and negligible impacts on the tree's population dynamics. Muntjac, by taking some of the seeds to open microhabitats, are projected to have a greater positive impact on C. axillaris demography than either sambar or gibbons. Model comparisons of population-level species impacts may allow us to predict which ecological interactions are at risk from loss of critical species.},

However, this tool is rarely applied in older sedimentary units. In this paper, the clay mineralogy of the Doushantuo Formation in South China is documented, providing constraints on depositional conditions of the Ediacaran Yangtze platform that host the earliest animal fossils in the geological record. In multiple sections from the Yangtze Gorges area, trioctahedral smectite (saponite) and its diagenetic products (mixed-layer chlorite/smectite, corrensite, and chlorite) are the dominant clays through the lower 80 m of the formation and constitute up to 30 wt\% of the bulk rock. Saponite is interpreted as an in situ early diagenetic phase that formed in alkaline conditions (pH ≥ 9). The absence of saponite in stratigraphically equivalent basin sections, 200–400 km to the south, indicates that alkaline conditions were localized in a nonmarine basin near the Yangtze Gorges region. This interpretation is consistent with crustal abundances of redox-sensitive trace elements in saponitic mudstones deposited under anoxic conditions, as well as a 10‰ difference in the carbon isotope record between Yangtze Gorges and basin sections. Our findings suggest that nonmarine environments may have been hospitable for the fauna preserved in the Yangtze Gorges, which includes the oldest examples of animal embryo fossils and acanthomorphic acritarchs.},

This study considers four common types of analyses where the X and Y variables are not independent; these include regressions of the form X/Z vs Y/Z, X×Z vs Y×Z, X vs Y/X, and X+Y vs Y. These analyses were carried out using a series of Monte Carlo simulations while varying sample size and sample variability. The impact of disparities in variability between the shared and non-shared terms and measurement error for the shared term on the magnitude of the spurious correlations was also considered. The accuracy of equations previously derived to predict the magnitude of spurious correlations was also assessed. These results show the risk of producing spurious correlations when analyzing non-independent variables is very large. Spurious correlations occurred in all cases assessed, the mean spurious coefficient of determination (r2) frequently exceeded 0.50, and in some cases the 90\% confidence interval for these simulations included all large r2 values. The magnitude of spurious correlations was sensitive to differences in the variability of the shared and non-shared terms, with large spurious correlations obtained when the variability for the shared term was larger. Sample size had only a modest impact on the magnitude of spurious correlations. When measurement error for the shared variable was smaller than one half the coefficient of variation for that variable, which is generally the case, the measurement error did not generate large spurious correlations. The equations available to predict expected spurious correlations provided accurate predictions for the case of X×Z vs Y×Z, variable predictions for the case of X vs Y/X, and poor predictions for most cases of X/Z vs Y/Z, and X+Y vs Y.},

	abstract = {Coordinated stasis, as defined herein, represents an empirical pattern, common in the fossil record, wherein groups of coexisting species lineages display concurrent stability over extended intervals of geologic time separated by episodes of relatively abrupt change. In marine benthic fossil assemblages, where the pattern was first recognized, the majority of species lineages (60 to more than 80\%) are present in their respective biofacies throughout timespans of 3–7 million years. Most lineages display morphological stasis or only very minor, typically non-directional, anagenetic change in a few characters throughout a prolonged time interval; evidence for successful speciation (cladogenesis) is rare, few lineages (\&lt;10\%) become extinct, and very few new immigrant taxa become established within a region or province during such intervals. Moreover, species associations (biofacies) are nearly constant during an interval of stability, showing very similar taxonomic membership, species richnesses, dominance-diversity patterns and guild structure throughout. Conversely, during the intervening episodes of rapid change, many species (generally 70\% or more) become extinct, at least locally, some lineages undergo rapid speciation and/or anagenetic change, and new immigrant taxa become successfully (semi-permanently) established. All (or most) biofacies arrayed across an environmental gradient display rapid and nearly synchronous changes in various aspects, including species composition, richness, dominance and guild structure. These intervals of abrupt evolutionary and ecological change typically represent only a small fraction (\&lt;10\%) of the duration of the stable units. The resulting stable blocks of species separated by turnover events comprise “ecological-evolutionary sub-units” in the Appalachian Basin type example, and are considered to be components of the longer, more generalized ecological evolutionary units (EEUs) recognized by Boucot, Sheehan, and others.

Causes of coordinated stasis and of regional ecological crisis/reorganization remain poorly understood. Tracking of spatially shifting environments appears to be the rule, rather than adaptation to local change. Incumbent species appear to have a very strong advantage and may excluded potential immigrants, as evidenced by temporary incursions of exotic taxa (“incursion epiboles”); this suggests a role for ecological and biogeographic factors in maintaining paleoecological stability. Stabilizing selection may be critical for producing morphological stability in individual lineages. Episodic crises appear to involve environmental perturbations that were too pervasive and/or abrupt to permit local tracking of environment to continue. Some faunal turnovers associated with unconformities may be partially an artifact of stratigraphic incompleteness. Others, however, seem to occur within conformable successions and were evidently rapid. Widespread anoxia, changes in current patterns, and/or climatic change associated with major marine transgression are common correlates of faunal turnovers in marine habitats in the Appalachian Basin.

The phenomenon of coordinated stasis has been noted, albeit not fully documented, in a number of ancient marine and terrestrial ecosystems. An important goal for evolutionary paleoecology should be to document the patterns of stability and change in common and rare members of fossil assemblages in order to discern the relative frequency of coordinated stasis in the rock record, to evaluate the mechanisms by which such apparent evolutionary and ecological stability might be produced, and to seek clues (e.g., paleobiological and stratigraphic patterns, geochemical anomalies) as to causes of abrupt pulses of faunal change.},

	abstract = {Aim  The biodiversity of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) along a complete tropical elevational gradient was studied for the first time. The patterns are described, and the role of geometric constraints and environmental factors is explored. Location  The study was carried out along the Barva Transect (10° N, 84° W), a complete elevational gradient ranging from 40 to 2730 m a.s.l. in Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica, and adjacent areas. Methods  Moths were sampled manually in 2003 and 2004 at 12 rain forest sites using light ‘towers’, each with two 15 W ultraviolet fluorescent tubes. We used abundance-based rarefaction, statistical estimation of true richness (Chao 1), geographically interpolated observed richness and Fisher's alpha as measures of local diversity. Results   A total of 13,765 specimens representing 739 species were analysed. All four measures showed a hump-shaped pattern with maxima between 500 and 2100 m elevation. The two subfamilies showed richness and diversity maxima at either lower (Ennominae) or higher (Larentiinae) elevation than Geometridae as a whole. Among the four environmental factors tested, relative humidity yielded the highest correlation over the transect with the rarefaction-based richness estimates as well as with estimated true species richness of Geometridae as a whole and of Larentiinae, while rainfall explained the greatest variation of Ennominae richness. The elevational pattern of moth richness was discordant with both temperature and with tree species richness. A combination of all environmental factors in a stepwise multiple regression produced high values of r2 in Geometridae. The potential effects of geometric constraints (mid-domain effect, MDE) were investigated by comparing them with observed, interpolated richness. Overall, models fitted very well for Geometridae as a whole and for Ennominae, but less well for Larentiinae. Small-ranged species showed stronger deviations from model predictions than large-ranged species, and differed strikingly between the two subfamilies, suggesting that environmental factors play a more pronounced role for small-ranged species. We hypothesize that small-ranged species (at least of the Ennominae) may tend to be host specialists, whereas large-ranged species tend to be polyphagous. Based on interpolated ranges, mean elevational range for these moths was larger with increasing elevation, in accordance with Rapoport's elevational rule, although sampling effects may have exaggerated this pattern. The underlying mechanism remains unknown because Rapoport's ‘rescue’ hypothesis could not explain the observed pattern. Conclusions  The results clearly show that moth diversity shows a hump-shaped pattern. However, remarkable variation exists with regard to taxon and range size. Both environmental and geometric factors are likely to contribute to the observed patterns.},

	abstract = {We examined the reproductive success and long—term population dynamics of Neotropical migrant birds in the fragmented landscapes of Illinois. Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self—sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source—sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism. Lack of data on dispersal is a major gap in understanding the population dynamics of Neotropical migrants and prescribing effective conservation measures.},

The model presented suggests that group foraging tactics, in combination with high mobility, are central to successful confrontational scavenging (interference competition), whereas individual foraging tactics and high mobility are central to successful nonconfrontational scavenging (exploitative competition). In contrast, group or individual foraging tactics and low mobility characterize the acquisition of fresh carcasses in low-competition contexts. Individual foraging tactics and low mobility are employed in response to extreme competition over marginal resources. Preliminary tests with data from Bed I Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora suggest that Plio-Pleistocene hominids, like other large-bodied predators, employed flexible foraging tactics involving changes in group size and levels of mobility to gain access to carcasses in both low-and high-competition contexts.},

	abstract = {Coevolution is defined as reciprocal selective pressures that operate to make the evolution of one taxon partially dependent on the evolution another. This process often involves multiple species exploiting shared limiting resources. In classic coevolutionary models, populations of sympatric species are seen to diverge in one or more morphological, ecological, or behavioral traits to effect more even partitioning of resources and reduce levels of interspecific competition. Character displacement and resource partitioning are thought to be central not only to how species coexist on limited resources, but also to how species invade new resource niches. Hominid invasion of the predatory guild at least 2 my ago would have brought them into contact with a range of new selective pressures including competition with a number of large-bodied predators. This study explores resource partitioning between hominids and other Plio-Pleistocene large-bodied predators through analyses of predator food transport strategies. The anatomical content (head/limb MNE) of hominid transported faunal assemblages at Bed I Olduvai and FxJj 50 (Koobi Fora), when compared to modern predator control cases, suggests that Plio-Pleistocene hominids practiced food transport strategies intermediate between those of top predators such as wolves and those of confrontational scavengers such as spotted hyaenas. Plio-Pleistocene hominid food transport strategies do not resemble those of nonconfrontational scavengers such as brown and striped hyenas. The highly regular patterns differentiating bone assemblages accumulated by top predators, hominids, and confrontational and nonconfrontational scavengers suggest that hominid invasion of the predatory guild involved resource partitioning potentially based on some form of character displacement.},

Here we assess how well humans perform at sustained long-distance running, and review the physiological and anatomical bases of endurance running capabilities in humans and other mammals. Judged by several criteria, humans perform remarkably well at endurance running, thanks to a diverse array of features, many of which leave traces in the skeleton. The fossil evidence of these features suggests that endurance running is a derived capability of the genus Homo, originating about 2 million years ago, and may have been instrumental in the evolution of the human body form.},

	abstract = {This review broadly summarizes how molecular biology has contributed to our understanding of human evolution. Molecular anthropology began in the 1960s with immunological comparisons indicating that African apes and humans were closely related and, indeed, shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 million years ago. Although initially dismissed, this finding has proven robust and numerous lines of molecular evidence now firmly place the human-ape divergence at 4–8 Ma. Resolving the trichotomy among humans, chimpanzees and gorillas took a few more decades. Despite the readily apparent physical similarities shared by African apes to the exclusion of modern humans (body hair, knuckle-walking, thin tooth enamel), the molecular support for a human–chimpanzee clade is now overwhelming. More recently, whole genome sequencing and gene mapping have shifted the focus of molecular anthropology from phylogenetic analyses to phenotypic reconstruction and functional genomics. We are starting to identify the genetic basis of the morphological, physiological and behavioural traits that distinguish modern humans from apes and apes from other primates. Most notably, recent comparative genomic analyses strongly indicate that the marked differences between modern humans and chimpanzees are likely due more to changes in gene regulation than to modifications of the genes themselves, an idea first proposed over 30 years ago. Almost weekly, press releases describe newly identified genes and regulatory elements that seem to have undergone strong positive selection along the human lineage. Loci involved in speech (e.g. FOXP2), brain development (e.g. ASPM), and skull musculature (e.g. MYH16) have been of particular interest, but some surprising candidate loci (e.g. those involved in auditory capabilities) have emerged as well. Exciting new research avenues, such as the Neanderthal Genome Project, promise that molecular analyses will continue to provide novel insights about our evolution. Ultimately, however, these molecular findings can only be understood in light of data from field sites, morphology labs, and museum collections. Indeed, molecular anthropology depends on these sources for calibrating molecular clocks and placing genetic data within the context of key morphological and ecological transitions in human evolution.},

At present, scientists using physical traits to study evolutionary relationships among living and extinct animals analyze data extracted from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks). Identifying and recording these landmarks is time consuming and can be done accurately only by trained morphologists. This necessity renders these studies inaccessible to nonmorphologists and causes phenomics to lag behind genomics in elucidating evolutionary patterns. Unlike other algorithms presented for morphological correspondences, our approach does not require any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user. It also differs from other seminal work in computational geometry in that our algorithms are polynomial in nature and thus faster, making pairwise comparisons feasible for significantly larger numbers of digitized surfaces. We illustrate our approach using three datasets representing teeth and different bones of primates and humans, and show that it leads to highly accurate results.},

	abstract = {The loss of species from ecological communities can unleash a cascade of secondary extinctions, the risk and extent of which are likely to depend on the traits of the species that are lost from the community. To identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled, dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on species’ connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further, to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models. This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover, there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low trophic levels. In contrast to previous studies we can infer, albeit indirectly, that secondary extinctions were triggered by both bottom-up and top-down cascades.

Der Verlust von Arten in ökologischen Gemeinschaften kann eine Kaskade von sekundären Aussterbeereignissen nach sich ziehen. Das Risiko für das Auftreten und Ausmaß solcher Kaskaden hängt möglicherweise von den Eigenschaften der ausgestorbenen Art ab. Um die Eigenschaften mit dem größten Einfluss auf die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen zu identifizieren, nutzen wir allometrisch skalierte, dynamische Nahrungsnetzmodelle und entfernen Arten in verschiedenen, auf der Konnektivität, Generalität oder Vulnerabilität der Art beruhenden Sequenzen. Des Weiteren vergleichen wir Ergebnisse topologischer und dynamischer Modelle, um die verschiedenen Effekte von Topologie und Dynamik auf die Nahrungsnetzrobustheit einschätzen zu können. Dieser Vergleich ergab, dass der topologische Ansatz die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen generell und besonders in einigen Sequenzen überschätzt. Im topologischen Modell haben “top-down” Sequenzen keine oder nur sehr wenige Auswirkungen auf die Robustheit der Netze, im dynamischen Modell hingegen können sie einen ebenso großen Effekt haben wie “bottom-up” Sequenzen. Außerdem gibt es im dynamischen Ansatz keine Aussterbe-Sequenzen, die fast oder gar keine sekundären Aussterbeereignisse auslösen. Stattdessen zeigt die am wenigsten schädliche Sequenz im dynamischen Ansatz eine ähnliche Robustheit wie die schädlichste (nicht basale) Sequenz im topologischen Ansatz. Demzufolge kann ein rein topologischer Ansatz zu falschen Rückschlüssen führen, was sowohl die relative als auch die absolute Bedeutung verschiedener Arteigenschaften auf die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen angeht. Der dynamische Ansatz zeigt, dass Nahrungsnetze auf das Aussterben von Arten mit vielen trophischen Interaktionen oder niedrigem trophischem Level am wenigsten robust reagieren. Im Gegensatz zu früheren Studien können wir, wenn auch nur indirekt, zeigen, dass sekundäre Aussterbeereignisse sowohl von “top-down” als auch von “bottom-up” Kaskaden ausgelöst werden.},

Nonetheless, numerous non-adaptive processes can shape realized niches and phenotypic variation in natural populations, complicating inferences about adaptive evolution at macroevolutionary scales. We tested for evolved differences in thermal tolerances and their association with the realized thermal niche (including metrics describing diurnal and seasonal patterns of temperature extremes and variability) across a genus of tropical freshwater fishes reared in a standardized environment. There was limited evolution along the thermal niche axis associated with variation in maximum temperature and of upper thermal limits. In contrast, there was considerable diversification along the first major axis of the thermal niche associated with minimum temperatures and in lower thermal limits. Across our adaptive landscape analyses, 70\% of species exhibited evidence of divergence in thermal niches. Most importantly, the first two major axes of thermal niche variation were significantly correlated with variation in lower thermal limits. Our results indicate adaptation to divergent thermal niches and adaptive evolution of related functional traits, and highlight the importance of divergence in lower thermal limits for the evolution of tropical biodiversity.

We transplanted seven common littoral species within, adjacent to, and below Spartina alterniflora cordgrass stands in control, cage control, cage, shade, and shaded cage treatments to test the hypothesis that cordgrass expands intertidal organism habitats. On cobble beaches, cordgrass ameliorates physical and predation stresses, expanding the distribution and realized niches of species to habitats in which they cannot live without facilitation, suggesting that niche theory and species distribution models should be amended to accommodate the role of positive interactions in community assembly.},

In parallel, functional ecologists have developed metrics to quantify the multiple facets of functional diversity in a n-dimensional space based on functional traits. Here, we transferred and adapted metrics developed by functional ecologists into a set of four isotopic diversity metrics (isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness and uniqueness) complementary to the existing metrics. Specifically, these new metrics are mathematically independent of the number of organisms analysed and account for the abundance of organisms. They can also be calculated with more than two stable isotopes. In addition, we also provide a procedure for calculating the levels of isotopic overlap (similarity and turnover) between two groups of organisms. These metrics have been implemented into new functions in R made freely available to users and we illustrated their application using stable isotope values from a freshwater fish community. Transferring the framework developed initially for measuring functional diversity to stable isotope ecology will allow more efficient assessments of changes in the multiple facets of isotopic diversity following anthropogenic disturbances.},

Research was complicated by the fact that the samples came from a curated collection and their precise provenance is unknown. The environmental dose rate was reconstructed by a series of in situ gamma spectrometric measurements and elemental analyses of a range of sediment samples. U-series isotopic analyses indicated that each of the teeth had a significantly different uranium uptake history, rendering the assumptive early U-uptake and linear U-uptake models ineffective. ESR and U-series data were combined to calculate open system ages, resulting in a best estimate of 1630±160 ka for the Hanging Remnant. An open-system model which provides the maximum age for given U-series and ESR measurements yielded an estimate of about 2100 ka.

Two bovid teeth from Member 2, previously estimated to be between 1·0 and 2·0 Ma, yielded age estimates of between about 100 and 200 ka. No known geochemical processes are likely to explain this severe age underestimation. We conclude that these samples are of Middle to Upper Pleistocene age and their presence in Member 2 was either due to reworking or inadequate stratigraphical discrimination of these deposits.},

Evenness of abundance in bird communities tends to vary with habitat type, with number of species, with average size of species, and to a lesser extent with variation in size of species. Communities in more complex habitats have more even abundance distributions, as do those with more species, with smaller species and with a greater variation in body mass. 3. When evenness of abundance within communities is calculated separately for different taxonomic groups of birds, some taxa typically have more even abundance distributions than others. Taxa in which the different species tend to have similar abundances are generally those which are species-rich or those with relatively low adult survival rates. 4. Competition is a potential explanation for the described patterns in evenness. Taxa and communities which have uneven abundance distributions tend to be those in which intra and inter-specific competition may be strongest.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic alterations of historical disturbance regimes (e.g. suppressing floods and wildfires) is a primary mechanism by which exotic species can come to dominate native communities. Unfortunately, reinstating historical disturbance regimes to restore native communities has achieved mixed success. The presence of positive frequency dependence (PFD) is commonly invoked to explain why exotic plant invasions are so difficult to eradicate. However, models examining PFD have not considered the effect of reintroducing disturbances. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we consider how magnitude and direction of frequency dependence of native and exotic species affects the success of reintroducing disturbances that favour fitness of natives over exotics. Our model illustrates why restoration is difficult; there is a narrow range of parameters that allows for native species to eliminate or coexist with exotics once they have established. Dominance by exotic invaders occurs with moderate initial frequencies of exotic individuals, aggregation of these individuals, or an exotic propagule production advantage. Reintroducing disturbances allows native dominance only when PFD of the exotic is weaker than that of the native species, disturbance intervals are short, and/or exotics are not initially frequent. Our framework provides guidelines for conditions in which the reintroduction of disturbances will effectively restore invaded habitats.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss often reduces the number of species as well as functional diversity. Dramatic effects to species composition have also been shown, but changes to functional composition have so far been poorly documented, partly owing to a lack of appropriate indices. We here develop three new community indices (i.e. functional integrity, community integrity of ecological groups and community specialization) to investigate how habitat loss affects the diversity and composition of functional traits and species. We used data from more than 5000 individuals of 137 bird species captured in 57 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly endangered biodiversity hotspot. Results indicate that habitat loss leads to a decrease in functional integrity while measures of functional diversity remain unchanged or are even positively affected. Changes to functional integrity were caused by (i) a decrease in the provisioning of some functions, and an increase in others; (ii) strong within-guild species turnover; and (iii) a replacement of specialists by generalists. Hence, communities from more deforested sites seem to provide different but not fewer functions. We show the importance of investigating changes to both diversity and composition of functional traits and species, as the effects of habitat loss on ecosystem functioning may be more complex than previously thought. Crucially, when only functional diversity is assessed, important changes to ecological functions may remain undetected and negative effects of habitat loss underestimated, thereby imperiling the application of effective conservation actions.},

We collected replicated and randomized plant data at 11 spatial scales from 0.01 to 108square meters in Great Britain which show that the slope of the log-log plot is not constant, but varies systematically with spatial scale, and from habitat to habitat at the same spatial scale. Values ofz were low (0.1 to 0.2) at small scales ({\textless}100 square meters), high (0.4 to 0.5) at intermediate scales (1 hectare to 10 square kilometers), and low again (0.1 to 0.2) for the largest scale transitions (e.g., East Berks to all of Berkshire).

	abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have long commented on a seemingly universal “rule” of nature—that in large taxonomic assemblages from groups as diverse as bacteria, plants, insects, marine invertebrates, fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, there exists a frequency distribution of body sizes among species that is highly skewed to the right (positive skewness). This distribution reflects the strong inverse, or negative, relationship often noted between mean body size of taxa and the number of species they contain—i.e., the observation that small body size is often associated with high species diversity (speciosity). This is sometimes “explained” by recourse to the idea that smaller-bodied taxa are able to subdivide their environments more finely than larger-bodied taxa. With but few exceptions, the applicability of this “rule” to the Order Primates has not been studied in any detail. In this study I address the following questions of (paleo)anthropological interest: (1) How speciose is the Order Primates? (2) Does this biological “rule” characterize the Order Primates (at any taxonomic level) in any meaningful way? (3) Does the association between speciosity and body mass within the Order Primates provide any useful models for interpreting and/or predicting speciosity in the fossil primate record? Using phylogenetically independent contrasts methods, I conclude that the answers to those three questions are: (1) not very; (2) no; and (3) not particularly (with the possible exception of larger-bodied taxa).},

	abstract = {Secondary succession reflects, at least in part, community assembly—the sequences of colonizations and extinctions. These processes in turn are expected to be sensitive to the size of the site undergoing assembly and its location relative to source pools. In this paper we describe patterns of succession over 18 years in an experimentally fragmented landscape created in eastern Kansas, USA, in 1984. The design of the experiment permits one to assess the influence of patch size and landscape position on successional dynamics. The general trajectory of succession follows that typical of succession in much of the eastern United States. In the initial years of the study, there was relatively little effect of patch size or distance to sources. Here we show that spatial effects in this system have become increasingly evident with time, as gauged both by repeated-measures ANOVA and ordination techniques. Woody plants have colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby patches. Species richness at a local (within-quadrat) scale in general has increased, with slightly greater richness in large than in small patches later in the study. Temporal stability in community composition has generally been greater in large patches. Spatial heterogeneity in community composition has increased during succession, but with different patterns in large and small patches. This long-term experiment suggests that landscape structure influences many aspects of community structure and dynamics during succession, and that such effects become more pronounced with the passage of time.},

	abstract = {The concept of “fitness” is of undisputed importance to evolutionary biology, but there is as yet little unanimity among evolutionists as to how it should be defined formally. In consequence a variety of mathematical fitness measures are in current use, and it is unclear which, if any of them, should be regarded as fundamental. In this paper a number of popular fitness measures are surveyed and their claims as indices of fitness examined critically. It is found that most of them probably fail to quantify the property of fitness in any fundamental or universal sense. One measure, however, possesses logical properties which recommend it as possibly fundamental. It is expected time to extinction, sometimes also called “average extinction time” or “mean survival time”. The expected time to extinction of a population or genotype is intimately related to the probability of its occurrence in such a way as to ensure the validity of certain common inference patterns found in optimization, adaptationist, and similar types of evolutionary reasoning. Thus its application is more readily justified on logical grounds than would be the use of other more traditional measures of fitness. The traditional measures may, however, be sufficiently closely associated with expected time to extinction to justify their use under certain special conditions.},

However, the reliability of these hypotheses has never been subjected to external validation. To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable molecular phylogenies are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies, these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence. The corollary of this is that existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable. Accordingly, new approaches are required to address the problem of hominin phylogeny.},

This stability results from compensatory processes which are initiated by disturbance; these adjust in proportion to the strength of the disturbance to prevent community change. By recognising such buffering processes, we might also learn to recognise the early warning signals of community shifts which are notoriously difficult to predict because communities often show little to no change before their tipping point is reached.},

	abstract = {Consider a collection C of individuals from several species residing ina region R which is the union of a number of nonoverlapping subregions. Let ni be the number of individuals from species i which belong to C and hence reside somewhere in R. The simplest hypothesis about the spatial distribution throughout R of the members of C is that their placement in dwelling sites is random and noninteractive, with the probability of a given individual of C residing in a particular subregion r of R equal to the ratio α ofthe area of r to the area of R. It is shown here that when this hypothesis of random placement holds, the mean s̄ and variance σ2 of the number of species from C represented in r are given by explicit functions of α, provided the number ni are known. Thus, if all the species in C have been censured, species-area data permit a test of the hypothesis of random placement. The nature of the dependence of s̄ and σ2 on α is discussed in detail for special cases in which the numbers ni are given by such theoritical abundance relations as the logarithmic series distribution, the “broken stick” distribution, the lognormal distribution, the Poisson lognormal distribution, and the gamma distribution. The arguments employed here to deduce consequences of the hypothesis of random choice are rigorous and exact. No use is made of the assumption, commonly made heretofore (but not in general correct, even under the hypothesis of random placement), that a species-area curve (giving the number of species expected to be found in a sample of known area) must have the same form as the corresponding collector's curve (giving the number of species expected in a sample of a known number of individuals). Nor is it assumed in advance, as is often done in the theory of island biogeography, that the distribution of individuals throughout the subregions of R is such thatthe species abundance relations for subregions of different areas must be of a preassigned type, i.e., must share a common form, such as that associated with a truncated lognormal distribution.},

These linear relationships, and scale-invariance in the proportions of basal, intermediate, and top species, make it possible to predict with remarkable precision the proportions of each kind of trophic link among all community food webs.

	abstract = {1. We have examined large-scale geographical patterns in species richness for continental shelf bryozoan assemblages in the North Atlantic. Bryozoans are common and often abundant benthic organisms, but they have not previously been examined at this scale of resolution. 2. Assemblage species richness was estimated by sample species richness. This was highest at intermediate depths (10–75 m) at all latitudes where there were sufficient data, but there was no statistically significant variation with depth for the overall data set (all latitudes pooled). Mean assemblage species richness showed no significant variation with latitude, although the highest individual values were generally from lower latitudes. There is thus as yet no convincing evidence for a latitudinal cline in the alpha diversity of North Atlantic bryozoans. 3. Pooling of data into bins of 10 degrees of latitude, or into biogeographic provinces, to estimate regional species richness revealed significant undersampling. Two independent techniques to correct for this undersampling revealed a latitudinal cline in the regional species richness of North Atlantic bryozoans, with a peak around 10–30°N, and a steady decrease in richness north to 80°N. 4. Two measures of beta diversity (Whittaker and Jaccard) revealed relatively high turnover, presumably related to habitat heterogeneity within regional bins or to significant environmental variation across bins. There was a tendency for beta diversity to be higher at lower latitudes, as would be expected from a combination of a latitudinal cline in regional diversity with a mean assemblage species richness invariant with latitude. Null models were used to clarify the expected relationship between the two measures of beta diversity, and these indicated a strong influence of species-abundance structure in the North Atlantic bryozoan data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Plant resprouting after disturbance confers community resilience because individuals persist through trade-offs in resources for buds versus those required to produce seeds. However, repeated disturbance may deplete bud banks, and population persistence may become increasingly reliant on regeneration from seed. Theory predicts a shift in community assemblage from species with a strategy of persistence by resprouting (persistence niche) to one of regeneration from seed (regeneration niche) as the disturbance frequency increases. We tested, for the first time, the shifting persistence niche concept in a model system at local and regional community scales using a phylogenetically diverse floristic assemblage. Persistence traits of vascular plants were modeled as a function of dry-down frequency in wetlands. Resprouting species occupying the persistence niche were more common in stable wetlands than in those more frequently disturbed by dry downs. The patterns of resprouting species in standing vegetation and in seed banks provide strong support for the shifting persistence niche model involving trade-offs between resprouting (clonality) and sexual reproduction.},

This additive approach led to a phylogenetic measure of differentiation between assemblages: (gamma − alpha)/gamma. We show both empirically and theoretically that this approach inherits all of the problems recently identified in the additive partitioning of non-phylogenetic generalized entropies. When within-assemblage (alpha) quadratic entropy is high, the additive beta and the differentiation measure (gamma − alpha)/gamma always tend to zero (implying no differentiation) regardless of phylogenetic structures and differences in species abundances across assemblages. Likewise, the differentiation measure based on the phylogenetic generalization of Shannon entropy always approaches zero whenever gamma phylogenetic entropy is high. Such critical flaws, inherited from their non-phylogenetic parent measures (Gini-Simpson index and Shannon entropy respectively), have caused interpretational problems. These flaws arise because phylogenetic generalized entropies do not obey the replication principle, which ensures that the diversity measures are linear with respect to species addition or group pooling. Furthermore, their complete partitioning into independent components is not additive (except for phylogenetic entropy). Just as in the non-phylogenetic case, these interpretational problems are resolved by using phylogenetic Hill numbers that obey the replication principle. Here we show how to partition the phylogenetic gamma diversity based on Hill numbers into independent alpha and beta components, which turn out to be multiplicative. The resulting phylogenetic beta diversity (ratio of gamma to alpha) measures the effective number of completely phylogenetically distinct assemblages. This beta component measures pure differentiation among assemblages and thus can be used to construct several classes of similarity or differentiation measures normalized onto the range [0, 1]. We also propose a normalization to fix the traditional additive phylogenetic similarity and differentiation measures, and we show that this yields the same similarity and differentiation measures we derived from multiplicative phylogenetic diversity partitioning. We thus can achieve a consensus on phylogenetic similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn measures. Hypothetical and real examples are used for illustration.},

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be utilized only by plants, though their abundance and growth rate is also greatly influenced by water. The Gibbs free energy (chemical energy) retained in the reduced organic compounds of tissue can be utilized by all heterotrophic organisms. Neither PAR nor chemical energy influences diversity directly. Both, however, influence biomass and/or abundance; diversity may then increase as a result of secondary population dynamic or evolutionary processes. Temperature is not a form of energy, though it is often used loosely by ecologists as a proxy for energy; it does, however, influence the rate of utilization of chemical energy by organisms. It may also influence diversity by allowing a greater range of energetic lifestyles at warmer temperatures (the metabolic niche hypothesis). We conclude that there is no single species/energy mechanism; fundamentally different processes link energy to abundance in plants and animals, and diversity is affected secondarily. If we are to make progress in elucidating these mechanisms, it is important to distinguish climatic effects on species' distribution and abundance from processes linking energy supply to plant and animal diversity.},

	abstract = {Aim

MacArthur and Wilson's original formulation of the theory of island biogeography (TIB) included the corollary hypothesis that species richness might affect immigration and extinction rates. Building on this, other researchers have suggested additional top-down and bottom-up effects. We compare these hypotheses to identify the strongest candidates for inclusion in a ‘trophic TIB’.


Location

Six mangrove islands in the Florida Keys, USA


Methods

We studied a classic island biogeography time series featuring lists of species observed on six mangrove islands during roughly 16 censuses each across 700 days. We first used this time series to determine the number of opportunities for species to immigrate to an island for the first time (n = 18,420), to go locally extinct (n = 1943) or to re-immigrate to an island after having previously gone extinct (n = 1813). We then leveraged information on the predators and prey of those species to estimate the potential for top-down and bottom-up interactions during each census period. Finally, we constructed statistical models to test for species richness, top-down, and bottom-up effects on per-species immigration and extinction probabilities and validated them by comparing each model with a similar model based on the classic TIB.


Results

We found that models including bottom-up effects gave the greatest improvement over the classic TIB models. Extinction probability in particular decreased sharply for species with both basal resources and animal prey available. Species richness and top-down effects had far weaker impacts on per-species probabilities of immigration and extinction.


Main conclusions

Our findings suggest that incorporating information on the trophic structure of island communities – particularly the species-specific availability of resources – can substantially alter predictions of extinction probabilities. Immigration probability, on the contrary, appeared largely stochastic. Incorporating trophic information into predictions of extinction rates therefore represents the most promising and best-supported way to extend the TIB.},

The cognitive function assessment consisted of 17 items and the number of correct answers a child could score therefore ranged between 0 and 17. In this upper bounded situation, a zero-inflated binomial model and a zero-inflated beta–binomial model were considered. The purpose of the analysis was to examine whether the growth status in infancy and at the age of 7 years was related to the cognitive function of the children. The four regression models proposed by Lucas, Fewtrell and Cole were fitted, i.e. an ‘early model’ relating early body size to the outcome, a ‘later model’ relating later body size to the outcome, a ‘combined model’ including both early and later anthropometry measures, and an ‘interaction model’ further including an interaction term calculated as the product of early and later body size. It was found that social variables predicted the probability of zero-inflation, while weight-for-age at 7 years predicted the proportion of correct answers. The results do not support the existence of a critical window of cognitive development in infancy. Rather they suggest that it is the lack of catch-up growth after poor growth in infancy that is hazardous, and that childhood weight gain is influential regardless of weight in infancy.

Despite widespread adoption of sample-based rarefaction curves, serious concerns persist. In this paper, we address the issue of the spatial arrangement of sampling units when computing sample-based rarefaction curves. If the spatial arrangement is neglected when building rarefaction curves, a direct comparison of species richness estimates obtained for areas that differ in their spatial extent is not possible, even if they were sampled with a similar intensity. We demonstrate a major effect of the spatial extent of the samples on species richness estimates through the use of data from a temperate forest. We show that the use of Spatially Constrained Rarefaction (SCR) results in species richness estimates that are directly comparable for areas that differ in spatial extent. As expected, standard rarefaction curves tend to overestimate species richness because they ignore the spatial autocorrelation of species composition among sampling units. This spatial autocorrelation is captured by the SCR, thus providing a useful technique for characterizing the spatial structure of biodiversity patterns. Further work is necessary to determine how species richness estimates and the shape of the SCR are affected by the method of spatial constraint and sampling unit density and distribution.},

The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding the model structure. This implicitly assumes the existence of a `true' model, which many would regard as a fiction. In practice model uncertainty is a fact of life and likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention from statisticians. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or, as is increasingly the case, when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative, interactive way. Modern computing power allows a large number of models to be considered and data-dependent specification searches have become the norm in many areas of statistics. The term data mining may be used in this context when the analyst goes to great lengths to obtain a good fit. This paper reviews the effects of model uncertainty, such as too narrow prediction intervals, and the non-trivial biases in parameter estimates which can follow data-based modelling. Ways of assessing and overcoming the effects of model uncertainty are discussed, including the use of simulation and resampling methods, a Bayesian model averaging approach and collecting additional data wherever possible. Perhaps the main aim of the paper is to ensure that statisticians are aware of the problems and start addressing the issues even if there is no simple, general theoretical fix.},

The patterns of genetic variation produced by these pleiotropic mutations and stabilizing selection for functionally and developmentally interacting traits results in their specific co-inheritance relative to other traits. This in turn leads to their co-ordinated response to selection. Therefore, functional and developmental integration lead to genetic integration which, in turn leads to evolutionary integration.

The simple exponential function was used for determination of the accumulated dose De and its appropriateness was discussed on the base of the experimental study. The closed system assumption was checked and the early uranium uptake model was applied to age determination. A mean age value was yielded to be 581±93 ka. It deviates from the palaeomagnetic dating result of 830-870 ka. Micro-regional complete saturation of ESR signal in enamel of very high U-content may account for the underestimation of ESR ages. Nevertheless both ESR and palaeomagnetic dating results place Yunxian crania in between the Homo erectus of Lantian and Zhoukoudian, which means that Yunxian crania constitute an important link in the human evolutionary lineage of China.},

But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In many cases, the relationship is 'hump-shaped', where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales10, 12, 14. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity–diversity relationship. Here, we present evidence for scale-dependent productivity–diversity patterns in ponds. When the data were viewed at a local scale (among ponds), the relationship was hump-shaped, whereas when the same data were viewed at a regional scale (among watersheds), the relationship was positively linear. This dependence on scale results because dissimilarity in local species composition within regions increased with productivity.},

Next, we show how accumulation and rarefaction curves can be used to dissect the effects of biodiversity scaling based on three components: total number of individuals (N), the shape of the species abundance distribution (SADs), and the pattern of spatial aggregation.  In a second meta-analysis of studies with multiple rarefaction curves, {\textasciitilde}30\% of them crossed, and the three components of biodiversity were uncorrelated, contradicting conventional wisdom that most biodiversity measures are strongly intercorrelated.  These results imply that there is no single 'magic metric' or scale for measuring biodiversity, and that multiple measures and scales are necessary to quantify biodiversity patterns.  We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-scale perspective reveals the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers, and allows for a more informed search for possible mechanisms.},

This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspecific aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.},

	abstract = {Based on a sample of individuals, we focus on inferring the vector of species relative abundance of an entire assemblage and propose a novel estimator of the complete species-rank abundance distribution (RAD). Nearly all previous estimators of the RAD use the conventional “plug-in” estimator p̂i (sample relative abundance) of the true relative abundance pi of species i. Because most biodiversity samples are incomplete, the plug-in estimators are applied only to the subset of species that are detected in the sample. Using the concept of sample coverage and its generalization, we propose a new statistical framework to estimate the complete RAD by separately adjusting the sample relative abundances for the set of species detected in the sample and estimating the relative abundances for the set of species undetected in the sample but inferred to be present in the assemblage. We first show that p̂i is a positively biased estimator of pi for species detected in the sample, and that the degree of bias increases with increasing relative rarity of each species. We next derive a method to adjust the sample relative abundance to reduce the positive bias inherent in p̂i. The adjustment method provides a nonparametric resolution to the longstanding challenge of characterizing the relationship between the true relative abundance in the entire assemblage and the observed relative abundance in a sample. Finally, we propose a method to estimate the true relative abundances of the undetected species based on a lower bound of the number of undetected species. We then combine the adjusted RAD for the detected species and the estimated RAD for the undetected species to obtain the complete RAD estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed RAD curve can unveil the true RAD and is more accurate than the empirical RAD. We also extend our method to incidence data. Our formulas and estimators are illustrated using empirical data sets from surveys of forest spiders (for abundance data) and soil ciliates (for incidence data). The proposed RAD estimator is also applicable to estimating various diversity measures and should be widely useful to analyses of biodiversity and community structure.},

Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.},

	abstract = {* The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (Rényi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q ≥ 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little).


* These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile.


* For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 ≤ q ≤ 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals.


* Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q ≤ 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.},

We derive simple new expressions for the expected values of the Shannon entropy of the equilibrium allele distribution at a neutral locus in a single isolated population under two models of mutation: the infinite allele model and the stepwise mutation model. Surprisingly, this complex stochastic system for each model has an entropy expressable as a simple combination of well-known mathematical functions. Moreover, entropy- and heterozygosity-based measures for each model are linked by simple relationships that are shown by simulations to be approximately valid even far from equilibrium. We also identify a bridge between the two models of mutation. We apply our approach to subdivided populations which follow the finite island model, obtaining the Shannon entropy of the equilibrium allele distributions of the subpopulations and of the total population. We also derive the expected mutual information and normalized mutual information (“Shannon differentiation”) between subpopulations at equilibrium, and identify the model parameters that determine them. We apply our measures to data from the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) in Australia. Our measures provide a test for neutrality that is robust to violations of equilibrium assumptions, as verified on real world data from starlings.},

	abstract = {* There are many concepts and measures of beta diversity and related similarity/differentiation indices. The variance framework (derived from the total variance of a community species abundance matrix) and diversity decomposition (based on partitioning gamma diversity into alpha and beta components) are two major approaches.


* There have been no bridges/links between the two approaches. Here, we establish a bridge by extending and modifying each approach so that both lead to the same classes of similarity/differentiation measures, which range in the interval [0, 1] and which can be compared across multiple sets of communities.


* Our extension/modification in each approach is based on the following major differences between the two approaches. (i) In the decomposition approach, a diversity order q that controls sensitivity to species abundances is used, whereas there is no such order involved in the variance approach. (ii) Transformations of raw abundances are typically used in the variance approach, whereas abundances are not transformed in diversity decomposition. (iii) The variance-based beta for non-transformed data is implicitly related to (and constrained by) alpha, gamma and total abundance. Namely, the attained maximum value of this beta when communities are completely distinct (no shared species) is not a fixed constant; the maximum varies with alpha, gamma and total abundance. By contrast, the beta component obtained from the multiplicative decomposition is not constrained by alpha, gamma and total abundance.


* To construct the bridge, we extend the variance of community data to a class of divergence measures (parameterized by an order q) and use normalization to remove these measures' constraints by alpha, gamma and total abundance. The resulting normalized divergence measures are legitimate differentiation measures. In the decomposition approach, we adopt a modified multiplicative decomposition scheme; the resulting beta component can be transformed to quantify compositional similarity/differentiation among communities. Then, the similarity/differentiation measures obtained from the extended variance framework turn out to be identical to those from the modified diversity decomposition, establishing the bridge.


* Other types of similarity/differentiation measures (e.g. N-community Bray–Curtis type) and extension to phylogenetic and functional versions are discussed. A real example using corals is given for illustration.},

However, pairwise similarity indices do not completely characterize multiple-community similarity because the information shared by at least three communities is ignored. We propose a new and intuitive two-stage probabilistic approach, which leads to a general framework to simultaneously compare multiple communities based on abundance data. The approach is specifically used to extend the commonly used Morisita index and NESS (normalized expected species shared) index to the case of N communities. For comparing N communities, a profile of N− 1 indices is proposed to characterize similarity of species composition across communities. Based on sample abundance data, nearly unbiased estimators of the proposed indices and their variances are obtained. These generalized NESS and Morisita indices are applied to comparison of three size classes of plant data (seedling, saplings, and trees) within old-growth and secondary rain forest plots in Costa Rica.},

	abstract = {There have been intense debates about the decomposition of regional diversity (gamma) into its within-community component (alpha) and between-community component (beta). Although a recent Ecology Forum achieved consensus in the use of “numbers equivalents” (Hill numbers) as the proper choice of diversity measure, three related major issues were still left unresolved. (1) What is the precise meaning of the “independence” or “statistical independence” of alpha diversity and beta diversity? (2) Which partitioning (additive vs. multiplicative) should be used for a given application? (3) What is the proper formula for alpha diversity, as there are two formulas in the literature? This paper proposes a possible resolution to each of these issues. For the first issue, we clarify the definitions of “independence” and “statistical independence” from two perspectives so that confusion about this issue can be cleared up. We also discuss the causes of dependence, so that the dependence relationship between any two diversity components in both partitioning schemes can be rigorously justified by theory and also intuitively understood by simulation. For the second issue, both multiplicative and additive beta diversities based on Hill numbers are useful measures and quantify different aspects of communities. However, neither can be directly applied to compare relative compositional similarity or differentiation across multiple regions with different numbers of communities because multiplicative beta diversity depends on the number of communities, and additive beta diversity additionally depends on alpha (equivalently, on gamma). Such dependences should be removed. We propose transformations to remove these dependences, and we show that the transformed multiplicative beta and additive beta both lead to the same classes of measures, which are always in a range of [0, 1] and thus can be used to compare relative similarity or differentiation among communities across multiple regions. These similarity measures include multiple-community generalizations of the Sørenson, Jaccard, Horn, and Morisita-Horn measures. For the third issue, we present some observations including a finding about which alpha formula produces independent alpha and beta components. These may help to resolve the choice of a proper formula for alpha diversity. Some related issues are also briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The classic Jaccard and Sørensen indices of compositional similarity (and other indices that depend upon the same variables) are notoriously sensitive to sample size, especially for assemblages with numerous rare species. Further, because these indices are based solely on presence–absence data, accurate estimators for them are unattainable. We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sørensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundance-based sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.},

Stable carbon isotopes can be used to give estimates of the C4/CAM fraction of diets of herbivorous mammals; stable nitrogen isotopes are related to the local water deficit; strontium isotopes are determined by the local geology. We studied hair from rhinos in Kenya to determine spatial patterns in δ13C, δ15N, and 87Sr/86Sr ratios. The samples of rhino hair were collected during Kenya Wildlife Service translocation or veterinary activities. δ13C values showed diets dominated by C3 foods, but in some regions the diet, at least seasonally, contained significant quantities (i.e., {\textgreater} ca. 20\%) of C4/CAM foods. δ15N values were related to water deficit, with higher δ15N values in regions with high water deficit. 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios were found to be related to the local geological substrate suggesting that 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios are provisionally useful for determining the origins of illegal wildlife materials in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa.},

	abstract = {A large stable isotope dataset from East and Central Africa from ca. 30 regional collection sites that range from forest to grassland shows that most extant East and Central African large herbivore taxa have diets dominated by C4 grazing or C3 browsing. Comparison with the fossil record shows that faunal assemblages from ca. 4.1–2.35 Ma in the Turkana Basin had a greater diversity of C3–C4 mixed feeding taxa than is presently found in modern East and Central African environments. In contrast, the period from 2.35 to 1.0 Ma had more C4-grazing taxa, especially nonruminant C4-grazing taxa, than are found in modern environments in East and Central Africa. Many nonbovid C4 grazers became extinct in Africa, notably the suid Notochoerus, the hipparion equid Eurygnathohippus, the giraffid Sivatherium, and the elephantid Elephas. Other important nonruminant C4-grazing taxa switched to browsing, including suids in the lineage Kolpochoerus-Hylochoerus and the elephant Loxodonta. Many modern herbivore taxa in Africa have diets that differ significantly from their fossil relatives. Elephants and tragelaphin bovids are two groups often used for paleoecological insight, yet their fossil diets were very different from their modern closest relatives; therefore, their taxonomic presence in a fossil assemblage does not indicate they had a similar ecological function in the past as they do at present. Overall, we find ecological assemblages of C3-browsing, C3–C4-mixed feeding, and C4-grazing taxa in the Turkana Basin fossil record that are different from any modern ecosystem in East or Central Africa.},

	abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth’s biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.
Humans are causing a massive animal extinction without precedent in 65 million years.

The significance of the following factors to metapopulation dynamics are explored: evolutionarychanges in colonization ability; habitat patch size and isolation; compensatory effects between colonization and extinctionrates; the effect of immigration on local dynamics (the rescue effect); and heterogeneity among habitat patches. The rescueeffect may lead to alternative stable equilibria in metapopulation dynamics. Heterogeneity among habitat patches may give riseto a bimodal equilibrium distribution of the fraction of patches occupied in an assemblage of species (the core-satellitedistribution). A new model of incidence functions is described, which allows one to estimate species' colonization andextinction rates on islands colonized from mainland. Four distinct kinds of stochasticity affecting metapopulation dynamicsare discussed with examples. The concluding section describes four possible scenarios of metapopulation extinction.

We demonstrate that this system satisfies the four necessary conditions for a species to persist in a balance between stochastic local extinctions and recolonizations. Patterns of patch occupancy support several qualitative and quantitative model predictions. With decreasing regional density and average area of habitat patches, the butterfly occurs in a diminishing fraction of suitable habitat. To our knowledge, this is the first conclusive demonstration, based on a comparison of many conspecific metapopulations, of declining habitat occupancy and hence of increasing threat to survival caused by increasing habitat fragmentation.},

	abstract = {A new concept is introduced to analyse species' regional distributions and to relate the pattern of distributions to niche relations. Several sets of data indicate that average local abundance is positively correlated with regional distribution, i.e. the fraction of patchily distributed population sites occupied by the species. This observation is not consistent with the assumptions of a model of regional distribution introduced by Levins. A corrected model is now presented, in which the probability of local extinction is a decreasing function of distribution, and a stochastic version of the new model is analysed. If stochastic variation in the rates of local extinction and/or colonization is sufficiently large, species tend to fall into two distinct types, termed the "core" and the "satellite" species. The former are regionally common and locally abundant, and relatively well spaced-out in niche space, while opposite attributes characterize satellite species. This dichotomy, if it exists, provides null hypotheses to test theories about community structure, and it may help to construct better structured theories. Testing the core-satellite hypothesis and its connection to the r-K theory and to Raunkiaer's "law of frequency" are discussed. /// Предлагается новая концепция дпя анализа регионального распределения видов и дпя сравнения характера распределения с соотношением ниш.

New fieldwork in West Turkana, Kenya, has identified evidence of much earlier hominin technological behaviour. We report the discovery of Lomekwi 3, a 3.3-million-year-old archaeological site where in situ stone artefacts occur in spatiotemporal association with Pliocene hominin fossils in a wooded palaeoenvironment. The Lomekwi 3 knappers, with a developing understanding of stone’s fracture properties, combined core reduction with battering activities. Given the implications of the Lomekwi 3 assemblage for models aiming to converge environmental change, hominin evolution and technological origins, we propose for it the name ‘Lomekwian’, which predates the Oldowan by 700,000 years and marks a new beginning to the known archaeological record.},

	abstract = {Common species shape the world around us, and changes in their commonness signify large-scale shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Dominant taxa drive productivity and biogeochemical cycling, in direct interaction with abiotic components of the Earth system. However, our understanding of the dynamic response of ecosystems to global environmental changes in the past is limited by our ability to robustly estimate fossil taxonomic richness, and by our neglect of the importance of common species. To rectify this, we use observations of the most common and widespread species to track global changes in their distribution in the deep geological past. Our simple approach is robust to factors that bias richness estimators, including widely used sampling-standardization methods, which we show are highly sensitive to variability in the species-abundance distribution. Causal analyses of common species frequency in the deep-sea sedimentary record detect a lagged response in the ecological prominence of planktonic foraminifera to oceanographic changes captured by deep-ocean temperature records over the last 65 million years, encompassing one of Earth's major climate transitions. Our results demonstrate that common species can act as tracers of a past global ecosystem and its response to physical changes in Earth's dynamic history.},

	abstract = {1. Communities develop through a process, community assembly, in which species invade, persist, or become extinct. 2. Community assembly is a sequence of different community states. Each state is a unique combination of species' presence or absence. The community transition graph is the directed graph of the transitions between states. Not all the transition graphs are ecologically sensible. 3. We investigated the statistical distribution of different community transition graphs that contain varying numbers of species. Does the species composition of a community persist? Or does it cycle, and, if so, through a few recognizable states or through a complex sequence that might appear superficially random? 4. We employ three recipes to construct the transition graphs. In the random transition graphs, the directions of the transitions are specified entirely at random. In the second recipe, we exclude all cycles by assigning each state a random `height.' The community transition graph moves from a `lower' state to one of its `higher' neighbours. This produces landscape transition graphs. The third recipe adds one ecological constraint to the random assembly models. We remove the simple, ecologically implausible cycles to produce minimal transition graphs. 5. Random transition graphs most commonly have one persistent state. Landscape transition graphs commonly have many more persistent states and the number increases rapidly with the number of species in the system. Persistent cycles are rare in the random graphs and are impossible in the landscape graphs. 6. Persistent states are nearly always reachable from the empty community in the random graphs. In the landscape graphs, with increasing numbers of species, the total number of persistent states increases more quickly than the number of reachable states. 7. Cyclical changes in composition en route to a persistent state are a dominant feature of the random graphs. The path lengths to a persistent state are often very long. 8. The third recipe excludes only the simple cycles. These minimal transition graphs have more than one persistent state. The number of persistent states increases rapidly with the number of species in the model. We did not find persistent cycles. Thus, models with even minimal ecological constraints appear very similar to the landscape transition graphs. Assembly resembles the process of evolution. It looks as though there is something that pushes the assembly towards peaks in a landscape. 9. Natural communities have had time to reach their persistent states, damaged communities are new ones. The persistent composition of natural communities should contrast with the ephemeral composition of damaged communities. 10. Ecological restoration may face the following dilemma. Random graphs may best describe community restoration. If so, the restoration might eventually reach its desired persistent community but only after a long period of intermediate cycling. In contrast, if landscape or minimal graphs best describe restoration, then it would quickly reach a persistent community. Unfortunately, this persistent community may not be the desired community. Even with all the species, we may be unable to reassemble communities. 11. The rugged nature of community landscapes produced from minimal assumptions suggests that the diversity of natural communities is a probable result of accidents of history.},

The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(1) and MA(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendall trend test.},

	abstract = {Global climate change has made what were seemingly extraordinary environmental conditions, such as prolonged droughts, commonplace. One consequence of extreme environmental change is concomitant changes in resource abundance. How will such extreme resource changes impact biodiversity? We developed a trait-based consumer-resource model to examine how resource abundance affects the potential for adaptive evolution and coexistence among competitors. We found that moderate changes in resource abundance have little effect on trait evolution. However, when resource scarcities were sufficiently extreme, a critical transition—a tipping point—occurred, which caused consumer traits to diverge and restructured the community in a way that outlasted the scarcity. Therefore, even though traits can evolve in response to minor resource fluctuations, large environmental shifts may be necessary for producing long-lasting impacts on community structure. These results may also help to illuminate patterns of stasis frequently observed in nature, despite the considerable evidence demonstrating rapid evolutionary change.},

Recent analyses of data, results of models, and examination of basic 1f-noise properties, suggest that pink 1{\textless}f noise, which lies midway between white noise and the random walk, might be the best null model of environment variation.

Changes in diversity are associated with changes in community structure, particularly during community assembly; therefore, by incorporating change over time, host community assembly may provide a framework to resolve causation. In turn, community assembly can be driven by many processes, including resource enrichment. To test the hypothesis that community assembly causally links host diversity to future disease, we experimentally manipulated host diversity and resource supply to hosts, then allowed communities to assemble for 2 years (surveyed 2012–2014). Initially, host diversity increased disease. Subsequently, host diversity did not directly alter disease. However, host diversity determined the trajectory of host community assembly, altering colonisation by exotic host species and richness-independent host phylogenetic diversity, which together reversed the initial increase in disease. Ultimately, incorporating the temporal dimension of community assembly revealed novel mechanisms linking host diversity to future disease.},

	abstract = {Summary. In a 1992 Technometrics paper, Lambert (1992, 34, 1–14) described zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression, a class of models for count data with excess zeros. In a ZIP model, a count response variable is assumed to be distributed as a mixture of a Poisson(λ) distribution and a distribution with point mass of one at zero, with mixing probability p. Both p and λ are allowed to depend on covariates through canonical link generalized linear models. In this paper, we adapt Lambert's methodology to an upper bounded count situation, thereby obtaining a zero-inflated binomial (ZIP) model. In addition, we add to the flexibility of these fixed effects models by incorporating random effects so that, e.g., the within-subject correlation and between-subject heterogeneity typical of repeated measures data can be accommodated. We motivate, develop, and illustrate the methods described here with an example from horticulture, where both upper bounded count (binomial-type) and unbounded count (Poisson-type) data with excess zeros were collected in a repeated measures designed experiment.},

Their primitive morphology and wear pattern demonstrate that A. kadabba is distinct from Ardipithecus ramidus. These fossils suggest that the last common ancestor of apes and humans had a functionally honing canine–third premolar complex. Comparison with teeth of Sahelanthropus and Orrorin, the two other named late Miocene hominid genera, implies that these putative taxa are very similar to A. kadabba. It is therefore premature to posit extensive late Miocene hominid diversity on the basis of currently available samples.

However, the weakest part of this hypothesis has been the absence of fossil samples between 3.6 and 3.9 million years ago. Here we describe new fossil specimens from the Woranso-Mille site in Ethiopia that are directly relevant to this issue. They derive from sediments chronometrically dated to 3.57–3.8 million years ago. The new fossil specimens are largely isolated teeth, partial mandibles, and maxillae, and some postcranial fragments. However, they shed some light on the relationships between Au. anamensis and Au. afarensis. The dental morphology shows closer affinity with Au. anamensis from Allia Bay/Kanapoi (Kenya) and Asa Issie (Ethiopia) than with Au. afarensis from Hadar (Ethiopia). However, they are intermediate in dental and mandibular morphology between Au. anamensis and the older Au. afarensis material from Laetoli. The new fossils lend strong support to the hypothesized ancestor-descendant relationship between these two early Australopithecus species. The Woranso-Mille hominids cannot be unequivocally assigned to either taxon due to their dental morphological intermediacy. This could be an indication that the Kanapoi, Allia Bay, and Asa Issie Au. anamensis is the primitive form of Au. afarensis at Hadar with the Laetoli and Woranso-Mille populations sampling a mosaic of morphological features from both ends. It is particularly difficult to draw a line between Au. anamensis and Au. afarensis in light of the new discoveries from Woranso-Mille. The morphology provides no evidence that Au. afarensis and Au. anamensis represent distinct taxa. Am J Phys Anthropol 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We present a comprehensive assessment of global HANPP based on vegetation modeling, agricultural and forestry statistics, and geographical information systems data on land use, land cover, and soil degradation that localizes human impact on ecosystems. We found an aggregate global HANPP value of 15.6 Pg C/yr or 23.8\% of potential net primary productivity, of which 53\% was contributed by harvest, 40\% by land-use-induced productivity changes, and 7\% by human-induced fires. This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species. We present maps quantifying human-induced changes in trophic energy flows in ecosystems that illustrate spatial patterns in the human domination of ecosystems, thus emphasizing land use as a pervasive factor of global importance. Land use transforms earth's terrestrial surface, resulting in changes in biogeochemical cycles and in the ability of ecosystems to deliver services critical to human well being. The results suggest that large-scale schemes to substitute biomass for fossil fuels should be viewed cautiously because massive additional pressures on ecosystems might result from increased biomass harvest.},

	abstract = {The holotype of the species Australopithecus bahrelghazali is a mandibular fragment preserving left C–P4 and right I2–P4. One of the key features of the A. bahrelghazali mandible is its sagittally and transversally flat anterior region associated with a vertical, bulbous symphysis that is assumed to differ morphologically from the classic, more apelike eastern australopith morphology with its sloping symphysis, developed transverse tori, and distinct genioglossal fossa. Yet, close similarity has been suggested between A. bahrelghazali and A. afarensis. To date, no metrical comparison of the symphyseal morphology of east and west African australopiths has been performed. For the selected characters, this study attempts to test the following null hypothesis: A. bahrelghazali does not present significant differences from A. afarensis (i.e., A. bahrelghazali vs. A. afarensis variation does not depart from expected intraspecific variation for hominoid species). Analysis of the mandibular symphysis is difficult to undertake using conventional linear variables since few landmarks are available to make a precise quantitative assessment of its morphology. In addition, while a few studies have used outline-based techniques of analysis to address symphyseal shape variation, none has integrated data on early hominins. We present here a detailed comparative study of variation in the symphyseal outline of A. bahrelghazali and A. afarensis based on a quantitative characterization by elliptic Fourier coefficients. Original data on symphyseal variation in Pliocene hominins are provided and discussed within a comparative framework of extant and fossil hominoid representatives. We evaluate the relevance of our quantitative data describing the shape of the symphysis for discriminating hominoid taxa, and test for differences in symphyseal shape between A. bahrelghazali and A. afarensis. Elliptic Fourier coefficients appear to be well-suited descriptors for depicting symphyseal variation within hominoids. Our results confirm that symphyseal shape is a good indicator of taxonomic affinity within hominoids, enabling a clear distinction between great apes, early hominins, and modern humans. Furthermore, our results substantiate the unusual pattern of the A. bahrelghazali symphyses compared to A. afarensis and support the specific status of the west African australopith.},

	abstract = {1  Spatial distribution–abundance relationships have been intensively studied. Workers have now begun to study temporal relationships but little is known about how these are related to spatial patterns. We examined these relationships both over space and time using 15 years of data from permanent quadrats in the Chihuahuan Desert. 2
Winter and summer annual communities were analysed. Within single years, the species in each community exhibited a positive relationship between distribution and abundance at two spatial scales, 0.25-ha plots and 0.25-m2 quadrats. Over 15 years, the species in each community also exhibited a positive relationship between abundance and the number of years in which they were present. Species frequency distributions, both in space and over time, were scale-dependent. 3  Over space, the frequency distribution was bimodal at large (plot) scales, but unimodal at small (quadrat) scales in both communities. Over time, the frequency distribution was bimodal for winter annuals but unimodal for summer annuals, a difference we attribute to the marked difference between the two communities in the temporal consistency of rank abundance of species. We conclude that both niche and metapopulation models can be used in explaining the distribution patterns of species but at different scales. The factors and processes in these models are not mutually exclusive in determining the overall abundance and distributions of these species in space and over time.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are a cause for concern in natural and economic systems and require both monitoring and management. There is a trade-off between the amount of resources spent on surveying for the species and conducting early management of occupied sites, and the resources that are ultimately spent in delayed management at sites where the species was present but undetected. Previous work addressed this optimal resource allocation problem assuming that surveys continue despite detection until the initially planned survey effort is consumed. However, a more realistic scenario is often that surveys stop after detection (i.e., follow a “removal” sampling design) and then management begins. Such an approach will indicate a different optimal survey design and can be expected to be more efficient. We analyze this case and compare the expected efficiency of invasive species management programs under both survey methods. We also evaluate the impact of mis-specifying the type of sampling approach during the program design phase. We derive analytical expressions that optimize resource allocation between monitoring and management in surveillance programs when surveys stop after detection. We do this under a scenario of unconstrained resources and scenarios where survey budget is constrained. The efficiency of surveillance programs is greater if a “removal survey” design is used, with larger gains obtained when savings from early detection are high, occupancy is high, and survey costs are not much lower than early management costs at a site. Designing a surveillance program disregarding that surveys stop after detection can result in an efficiency loss. Our results help guide the design of future surveillance programs for invasive species. Addressing program design within a decision-theoretic framework can lead to a better use of available resources. We show how species prevalence, its detectability, and the benefits derived from early detection can be considered.},

These ANNs are the most recent development in computer-aided identification and are very different from conventional techniques,. Here we use the potential of ANNs to deal with some of the persistent fuzzy and nonlinear problems that confound classical statistical methods for species diversity prediction. We show that riverine fish diversity patterns on a global scale can be successfully predicted by geographical patterns in local river conditions. Nonlinear relationships, fitted by ANN methods, adequately describe the data, with up to 93 per cent of the total variation in species richness being explained by our results. These findings highlight the dominant effect of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity on patterns of global fish diversity. Our results reinforce the species-energy theory and contrast with those from a recent study on North American mammal species, but, more interestingly, they demonstrate the applicability of ANN methods in ecology.},

CT scans have made it possible to create virtual imprints of the braincase—so called endocasts—on the computer, even when the endocranial cavity is filled with stone matrix. CT data have also become invaluable for reconstructing partially complete or damaged fossils. Recent methodological advancements have made it possible to analyse endocranial shape using multivariate statistics and study the evolution and development of the endocranium quantitatively. Here I review (1) methods for quantifying endocranial shape, and (2) techniques of virtual fossil reconstruction.

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

This study demonstrates the particular strength that lies in the integration of ESR and U-series dating analyses allowing the estimation of the U-uptake history. We obtained a combined ESR/U-series age estimate of 412±25 ka (average of six analyses on two teeth). This pinpoints the deposition of the faunal remains to the time of the transition between oxygen isotope stages 12 and 11. This is in agreement with the faunal composition which show a mixture of cold adapted northern mammals and more subtropical-tropical southern elements.

	abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities1,2,3,4,5. On the other hand, neutral models6,7,8,9, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance10, and a strong positive correlation between a species’ abundance and its age11, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions12,13, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades14,15,16, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear5. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

The present study demonstrates the usefulness of eigenfunctions in spatial modeling applied to ecological problems and shows equivalencies of and differences between the two current implementations of this methodology. The two approaches in this category are the distance-based (DB) eigenvector maps proposed by P. Legendre and his colleagues, and spatial filtering based upon geographic connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D. A. Griffith and his colleagues. In both cases, the goal is to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into conventional regression models. One important advantage of these two approaches over any other spatial approach is that they provide a flexible tool that allows the full range of general and generalized linear modeling theory to be applied to ecological and geographical problems in the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation.},

	abstract = {* 1Compared with most terrestrial data sets used in development of theoretical models, what characterizes data sets from marine soft sediments is that they have a very high number of species. Marine data also show large numbers of rare species, even if the extent of the study is greatly increased from a few square metres to hundreds of square kilometres.
* 2Fitting log-normal distributions to data on species abundance distributions (SADs) for marine benthic assemblages from the continental shelf of Norway, and for the well-studied tropical tree data of Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), show patterns suggesting that more than one log-normal distribution occurs.
* 3We have developed a simple model of SADs comprising two groups of log-normally distributed species, a group of rare species and a group of common species. The model appears to fit the marine data and also applies to the BCI tropical tree data and yet is simpler than Hubbell's Zero-Sum Multinomial (ZSM) distribution model.
* 4The plots of the model results show that the marine data are dominated by the rare group of species at all scales studied. In the tropical tree assemblage a similar pattern to that in the marine data is apparent only at small spatial scales (5 and 10 ha), but not at the larger extent (25–50 ha). It is important to note, however, that marine data at all the scales studied are samples from a given area, whereas the terrestrial data are exact counts of all species of tree within the total 50 ha plot studied.
* 5Most ecological data are likely to be based on samples rather than exact counts so the patterns found with the marine data are likely to be common, and our findings general ones.
* 6A biological explanation for the two-group log-normal model is that recruitment of rare species from outside the studied area dominates benthic assemblages of soft sediments at all sampled scales. Within the tropical forest the dominance of recruitment processes are only apparent at small scales.
* 7Thus, the interpretation of SAD patterns depends greatly on the type of data collected, i.e. whether they are exact counts or samples. We believe that structuring processes are similar in marine and many terrestrial systems and these processes probably conform to the mass-effects paradigm of the newly termed meta-community concept.},

	abstract = {We present a theory extending the source—sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source—sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In metaecosystems, the source—sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology.},

	abstract = {We believe that punctuational change dominates the history of life: evolution is concentrated in very rapid events of speciation (geologically instantaneous, even if tolerably continuous in ecological time). Most species, during their geological history, either do not change in any appreciable way, or else they fluctuate mildly in morphology, with no apparent direction. Phyletic gradualism is very rare and too slow, in any case, to produce the major events of evolution. Evolutionary trends are not the product of slow, directional transformation within lineages; they represent the differential success of certain species within a clade-speciation may be random with respect to the direction of a trend (Wright's rule). As an a priori bias, phyletic gradualism has precluded any fair assessment of evolutionary tempos and modes. It could not be refuted by empirical catalogues constructed in its light because it excluded contrary information as the artificial result of an imperfect fossil record. With the model of punctuated equilibria, an unbiased distribution of evolutionary tempos can be established by treating stasis as data and by recording the pattern of change for all species in an assemblage. This distribution of tempos can lead to strong inferences about modes. If, as we predict, the punctuational tempo is prevalent, then speciation-not phyletic evolution-must be the dominant mode of evolution. We argue that virtually none of the examples brought forward to refute our model can stand as support for phyletic gradualism; many are so weak and ambiguous that they only reflect the persistent bias for gradualism still deeply embedded in paleontological thought. Of the few stronger cases, we concentrate on Gingerich's data for Hyopsodus and argue that it provides an excellent example of species selection under our model. We then review the data of several studies that have supported our model since we published it five years ago. The record of human evolution seems to provide a particularly good example: no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, and many are long-ranging; the trend to larger brains arises from differential success of essentially static taxa. The data of molecular genetics support our assumption that large genetic changes often accompany the process of speciation. Phyletic gradualism was an a priori assertion from the start-it was never "seen" in the rocks; it expressed the cultural and political biases of 19th century liberalism. Huxley advised Darwin to eschew it as an "unnecessary difficulty." We think that it has now become an empirical fallacy. A punctuational view of change may have wide validity at all levels of evolutionary processes. At the very least, it deserves consideration as an alternate way of interpreting the history of life.},

	abstract = {* The variational properties of living organisms are an important component of current evolutionary theory. As a consequence, researchers working on the field of multivariate evolution have increasingly used integration and evolvability statistics as a way of capturing the potentially complex patterns of trait association and their effects over evolutionary trajectories. Little attention has been paid, however, to the cascading effects that inaccurate estimates of trait covariance have on these widely used evolutionary statistics.


* Here, we analyze the relationship between sampling effort and inaccuracy in evolvability and integration statistics calculated from 10-trait matrices with varying patterns of covariation and magnitudes of integration. We then extrapolate our initial approach to different numbers of traits and different magnitudes of integration and estimate general equations relating the inaccuracy of the statistics of interest to sampling effort. We validate our equations using a dataset of cranial traits, and use them to make sample size recommendations.


* Our results suggest that highly inaccurate estimates of evolvability and integration statistics resulting from small sample sizes are likely common in the literature, given the sampling effort necessary to properly estimate them. We also show that patterns of covariation have no effect on the sampling properties of these statistics, but overall magnitudes of integration interact with sample size and lead to varying degrees of bias, imprecision, and inaccuracy.


* Finally, we provide R functions that can be used to calculate recommended sample sizes or to simply estimate the level of inaccuracy that should be expected in these statistics, given a sampling design.

We found strong phylogenetic signal in both leaf δ13C and δ15N, suggesting that close relatives have similar physiological strategies. The signal of phylogeny was generally stronger than that of the local environment. However, within some specialized environments (e.g., wetlands, sandy soils), we found environmental effects and/or niche conservatism. Phylogenetic signal in δ13C appears to be most closely related to the constraints on metabolic demand and supply of C, and δ15N appears to be most strongly related to mycorrhizal associations within the family.},

	abstract = {The presumed geometry of clam and brachiopod clades (brachiopod declines matched closely by clam increases) has long served as primary data for the classic case of gradual replacement by competition in geological time. Agassiz invoked the geometric argument to assert the general superiority of clams, and it remains the standard textbook illustration today. Yet, like so many classic stories, it is not true. The supposed replacement of brachiopods by clams is not gradual and sequential. It is a product of one event: the Permian extinction (which affected brachiopods profoundly and clams relatively little). When Paleozoic and post-Paleozoic times are plotted separately, numbers of clam and brachiopod genera are positively correlated in each phase. Each group pursues its characteristic and different history in each phase—clams increasing, brachiopods holding their own. The Permian extinction simply reset the initial diversities. The two groups seem to track each other in each phase and a plot of brachiopod vs. clam residuals (each from their own within-phase regressions against time) yields significantly positive association. Some of this tracking may be an artifact of available rock volumes; we could, however, detect no effect of stage lengths. Passive extrapolation of microevolutionary theory into the vastness of geological time has often led paleontologists astray. Competitive interaction may rule in local populations, but differential response to mass extinctions (surely not a matter of conventional competition) may set the relative histories of large groups through geological time. Similarly, adaptive superiority in design cannot, in the usual sense of optimal engineering, have much to do with the macroevolutionary success of clams. The interesting question lies one step further back: what in the inherited Bauplan of a clam permits flexibility in design and why are other groups, however successful in their own domain, unable to alter their basic design.},

Since Laplace's studies of the perturbations of the planets, matrices have played an important role in other fields of study in reordering known facts to provide new insights. By transforming cartographical data into numbers, which are mathematically far more tractable, similar insights may be forthcoming in geography. After a consideration of the nature of eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors, a wide variety of different applications is examined by reference to specific examples. These include analyses of terrain roughness on the New Jersey Coastal Plain, the Allegheny Plateau and the adjacent Ridge and Valley Province; connectivity matrices, as applied to the study of road networks in Uganda and Syria at different periods; the orientation of features as different as stream pebbles and transport networks in Tanzania and Sierra Leone; the diffusion of information; regional classification, by reference to church forms in Centre County, Pennsylvania; and principal components, in relation to the ranked preferences of university students in Ghana and Europe for different areas. Suggestions are offered for the further development of analyses of this kind, which may help to provide many more truly geographical explanations.},

This radical break with a past philosophy based on irreducible historical uniqueness is still impeded by (1) overreliance upon the inductivist methodology that embodied this previous philosophy, and (2) an unadventurous approach to biology that attempts passively to transfer the orthodoxies of microevolutionary theory across vast stretches of time and several levels of a hierarchy into the domain of macroevolution. I analyze the major trends of recent invertebrate paleobiology in the light of these two impediments. The formulation, by paleobiologists and with paleobiological data, of new macroevolutionary theories should end the subservience of passive transfer and contribute, in turn, to the formulation of a new, general theory of evolution that recognizes hierarchy and permits a set of unifying principles to work differently at various levels.},

Phyletic change in P. vema occurred at varying rates, but changes in the morphologic rate of evolution do not correspond to any obvious breaks in the fossil record such as would be indicated by missing segments of the core's magnetic stratigraphy. Variation in thoracic width, as measured by the coefficient of variation, does not depend on the morphologic rate of evolution, proportional rate of evolution, nor the amount of time required for the width to change by one standard deviation, so much as it depends on whether change was accomplished by addition or removal of extreme phenotypes to or from the population.},

Using a metacommunity simulation incorporating quantitative models of trait evolution and community assembly, I assessed the performance of different tests that have been used to measure community phylogenetic structure. All tests were sensitive to the relative phylogenetic signal in species metacommunity abundances and traits; methods that were most sensitive to the effects of niche-based processes on community structure were also more likely to find non-random patterns of community phylogenetic structure under dispersal assembly. When used with a null model that maintained species occurrence frequency in random communities, several metrics could detect niche-based assembly when there was strong phylogenetic signal in species traits, when multiple traits were involved in community assembly, and in the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Interpretations of the causes of community phylogenetic structure should be modified to account for the influence of dispersal.},

	abstract = {Aim  To examine frequency distributions of body sizes for mammal assemblages at several spatial scales and assess the generality of results heretofore obtained only for North and South America. Location  Africa. Methods  Terrestrial African mammals were allocated to major biomes, and regional and local assemblages were extracted from published and unpublished literature. We produced body size frequency distributions for local, regional, biomic and continental distributions, both for whole assemblages and for three foraging strata, and compared these with several standard metrics (e.g. mean and median size, interquartile range, skew, bimodality, etc.). Differences between distributions were quantified using t-tests and analysis of variance. Results  African mammal faunas exhibit features in common with those of North and South America, most notably the gradual reduction in the modality and skew of body size distributions with decreasing spatial scale. Unlike other continents, however, the African mammal fauna exhibits a bimodal frequency distributions at all spatial scales. Our data suggest a role for competitive interactions in local assembly, as documented elsewhere, but further data on locally interacting assemblages are needed. Main conclusions  The African fauna appears unique in the expression of bimodality at all spatial scales. The presence of a secondary mode at large body size may reflect co-evolutionary adjustments to proto-human hunters and consequent escape from anthropogenic Pleistocene extinctions, but the absence of species of intermediate body size (c. 250–4000 g) remains anomalous and is not readily explained by either historical or modern (ecological) factors. For the African mammal fauna, a key question in understanding the role of history versus ecology may not be why there are so many large species, but why there are so few intermediate-sized species.},

However, detailed mechanistic information on how herbivores affect dominance hierarchies between plant species is scarce.

Moreover, we assessed species-specific values of plant defense of these 28 species measured as the performance of a generalist caterpillar, and the preference of the caterpillar and a slug species in no-choice and choice feeding experiments, respectively. We show that more preferred species in the feeding experiments were those that increased in cover after herbivore exclusion in the field, whereas less preferred ones decreased. Herbivore performance and several measured leaf traits were not related to the change in plant cover in the field in response to herbivore removal. Additionally, the generalist slug and the generalist caterpillar preferred and disliked the same plant species, indicating that they perceive the balance between defense and nutritional value similarly. We conclude that the growth-defense tradeoff in grassland species acts via the preference of herbivores and that among-species variation in plant growth and preference to herbivores drives plant community composition.},

	abstract = {* 1Taxocenes — monophyletic ecological assemblages — are a key focus of macroecology. Abundance (individuals per area) is a basic property of taxocenes but has received less attention than diversity, although the two are probably related. Abundance reflects a taxocene’s ability to harvest and sequester available energy and divide it among individuals. This paper explores how two properties of all taxocenes — trophic makeup and taxonomic level (e.g. genus, tribe, subfamily, family … ) — may contribute to patterns of local abundance at geographical scales.
* 2Forty-nine ground ant taxocenes, in habitats ranging from New World deserts to rain forests, were surveyed along a three-orders of magnitude productivity gradient using transects of 30 1-m2 quadrats at each site. Abundance — the number of nests per transect — varied over two orders of magnitude.
* 3Over 80\% of the genera collected were omnivores. However, herbivore, omnivore, and predator taxa were added to ant taxocenes in roughly 1 order of magnitude steps up the productivity gradient. Specialist detritivores were added last.
* 4Net primary productivity and mean monthly temperature both consistently entered regression models predicting abundance. However, while productivity was the dominant predictor of abundance for higher taxa (families, subfamilies), temperature was the dominant predictor of abundance for lower taxa (tribes, genera). The answer to the question ‘What regulates the abundance of a taxocene?’ is thus sensitive to the taxonomic level of analysis.
* 5These data support the following scenario. Lower taxa are abiotic specialists given the insufficient number of genomes and generations required for the exploration of the entire abiotic envelope. Higher taxa, in contrast, consist of suites of abiotic specialists arrayed along the entire productivity gradient, with access to productivity everywhere the taxon occurs. If this scenario is true, individual species may respond to global changes in temperature; the higher taxa they belong to may most respond to global changes in productivity.},

Habitat reconstructions typically rely upon various biological or physical habitat indicators, and here we present reconstructions of the Plio-Pleistocene paleohabitats of Koobi Fora and Olduvai Gorge as based on fossil bovids (Artiodactyla: Bovidae). Bovids are the most common faunal element at most Neogene hominid and hominoid fossil localities and have been widely studied. This study addresses the funtional morphology of the bovid femur through discriminant function analysis and provides additional support for the observation that certain features of the femur demonstrate clear correlations with the amount of vegetative cover in different modern habitats. The reconstructions for both Koobi Fora and Olduvai Gorge suggest that the full range of environments inhabited by living bovids was present during the Plio-Pleistocene. Koobi Fora appears to have had a somewhat higher percentage of more closed habitats than the relatively more open habitats of Olduvai Gorge. These habitat reconstructions are in broad agreement with other reconstructions based on a purely taxonomic approach to the bovid remains. Grounding our reconstructions of paleoenvironments in studies of functional morphology can help to develop a richer idea of the habitats and resources available to early hominids.},

The energy limitation hypothesis links the species richness of consumer taxa to net primary productivity (NPP) through two relationships: NPP limits a taxon's density, and taxon density limits species richness. We study both relationships with a survey of 15 ground ant assemblages, along a productivity gradient from deserts to rain forests. Ant density (colonies m−2) was a positive, decelerating function of net aboveground productivity (NAP). A stepwise regression suggests that the efficiency with which NAP is converted to ant colonies increases with maximum summer temperature and decreases with precipitation. Ant species richness was a positive decelerating function of density at three spatial scales. This supports the energy limitation hypothesis' assumption that average population densities are higher in environments that are more productive. These two nonlinear functions (NAP‐density and density‐species richness) combine to create, at a variety of scales, positive, decelerating, productivity‐diversity curves for a common, ecologically dominant taxon across the terrestrial productivity gradient. However, variance in the density and diversity explained by NAP decreases with scale, suggesting that energy limitation of diversity predominates at small spatial scales ({\textless}1 ha).},

	abstract = {Niche partitioning facilitates species coexistence in a world of limited resources, thereby enriching biodiversity. For decades, biologists have sought to understand how diverse assemblages of large mammalian herbivores (LMH) partition food resources. Several complementary mechanisms have been identified, including differential consumption of grasses versus nongrasses and spatiotemporal stratification in use of different parts of the same plant. However, the extent to which LMH partition food-plant species is largely unknown because comprehensive species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers: Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance (RRA) ranged from {\textgreater}99\% (plains zebra) to {\textless}1\% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of \% grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species—even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location—and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.},

	abstract = {Skull IX (Tjg-1993.05) was unearthed from the upper stratigraphic zone (Bapang-AG levels) of the hominin-bearing sequence in Sangiran. This remarkably complete cranial specimen of Homo erectus from the early Pleistocene of Java preserves substantial portions of the vault and face. However, the distortion present in the original reconstruction has hampered detailed documentation of its morphological characteristics. We here report a new reconstruction of Skull IX that successfully recovers the original morphology and significantly differs from previous reconstructions. Detailed morphological description and the results of initial comparative analyses based on this new reconstruction are provided.

The endocranial volume of Skull IX was measured as 870 cc using micro-CT data. The neurocranium of Skull IX is slightly smaller than the so far recorded smallest cranium from this zone, suggesting this individual was female. In most, but not all, aspects of the cranial vault form, details of the external surface structures, and facial morphology, Skull IX exhibits numerous similarities to the other Bapang-AG H. erectus specimens, indicating that it belonged to the Bapang-AG H. erectus population. Drawing on the expanded fossil sample of this chronoregional H. erectus group, we discuss their evolutionary status, degree of sexual dimorphism, and facial morphological variation in Afro-Asian earlier Homo specimens.},

Such increased environmental variability might in turn result in increased variation in the demographic rates of interacting species with potentially important consequences for the dynamics of food webs. Using a theoretical approach, we here explore the response of food webs to a highly variable environment. We investigate how species richness and correlation in the responses of species to environmental fluctuations affect the risk of extinction cascades. We find that the risk of extinction cascades increases with increasing species richness, especially when correlation among species is low. Initial extinctions of primary producer species unleash bottom-up extinction cascades, especially in webs with specialist consumers. In this sense, species-rich ecosystems are less robust to increasing levels of environmental variability than species-poor ones. Our study thus suggests that highly species-rich ecosystems such as coral reefs and tropical rainforests might be particularly vulnerable to increased climate variability.},

To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha × beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.},

	abstract = {Almost half a century after Whittaker (Ecol Monogr 30:279–338, 1960) proposed his influential diversity concept, it is time for a critical reappraisal. Although the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity introduced by Whittaker have become general textbook knowledge, the concept suffers from several drawbacks. First, alpha and gamma diversity share the same characteristics and are differentiated only by the scale at which they are applied. However, as scale is relative––depending on the organism(s) or ecosystems investigated––this is not a meaningful ecological criterion. Alpha and gamma diversity can instead be grouped together under the term “inventory diversity.” Out of the three levels proposed by Whittaker, beta diversity is the one which receives the most contradictory comments regarding its usefulness (“key concept” vs. “abstruse concept”). Obviously beta diversity means different things to different people. Apart from the large variety of methods used to investigate it, the main reason for this may be different underlying data characteristics. A literature review reveals that the multitude of measures used to assess beta diversity can be sorted into two conceptually different groups. The first group directly takes species distinction into account and compares the similarity of sites (similarity indices, slope of the distance decay relationship, length of the ordination axis, and sum of squares of a species matrix). The second group relates species richness (or other summary diversity measures) of two (or more) different scales to each other (additive and multiplicative partitioning). Due to that important distinction, we suggest that beta diversity should be split into two levels, “differentiation diversity” (first group) and “proportional diversity” (second group). Thus, we propose to use the terms “inventory diversity” for within-sample diversity, “differentiation diversity” for compositional similarity between samples, and “proportional diversity” for the comparison of inventory diversity across spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon–Wiener and Gini–Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

We explore this idea to examine currently proposed unified theories of biodiversity (UTBs) and their predictions. Synthesizing the literature on the macroecological patterns of mammals, we critically evaluate the evidence to support these theories. We find general qualitative support for the UTBs' predictions within mammals, but rigorous testing is hampered by the types of data typically collected in studies of mammals. In particular, abundance is rarely estimated for entire mammalian communities or of individual species in multiple locations, reflecting the logistical challenges of studying wild mammal populations. By contrast, there are numerous macroecological patterns (especially allometric scaling relationships) that are extremely well characterized for mammals, but which fall outside the scope of current UTBs. We consider how these theories might be extended to explain mammalian biodiversity patterns more generally. Specifically, we suggest that UTBs need to incorporate the dimensions of geographical space, species' traits and time to reconcile theory with pattern.},

	abstract = {During the African Humid Period (AHP, 15–5 ka BP) an almost 300 m deep paleo-lake covering 2200 km2 developed in the Suguta Valley, in the Northern Kenya Rift. Data from lacustrine sediments and paleo-shorelines indicate that a large paleo-lake already existed by 13.9 ka BP, and record rapid water level fluctuations of up to 100 m within periods of 100 years or less, and a final lowstand at the end of the AHP (5 ka BP). We used a hydro-balance model to assess the abruptness of these water level fluctuations and identify their causes. We observed that fluctuations within the AHP were caused by abrupt changes in precipitation of 26–40\%. Despite the absence of continuous lacustrine data documenting the onset of the AHP in the Suguta Valley, we conclude from the hydro-balance model that only an abrupt onset to the AHP, prior to 14.8 ka BP, could have led to high water levels recorded. The modeling results suggest that the sudden increase in rainfall was the direct consequence of an eastward migration of the Congo Air Boundary (CAB), caused by an enhanced atmospheric pressure gradient between East Africa and southern Asia during a northern hemisphere (NH) summer insolation maximum. In contrast, the end of the AHP must have been gradual despite an abrupt change in the source of precipitation when a decreasing pressure gradient between Asia and Africa prevented the CAB from reaching the study area. This abruptness was probably buffered by a contemporaneous change in precession producing an insolation maximum at the equator during September–October. This change would have meant that the only rain source was the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which would have carried a greater amount of moisture during the short rainy season thus slowing the fall in water level over a period of about 1000 years in association with the reduction in insolation. The results of this study provide an indication of the amount of time available for humans in north-eastern Africa to adapt in response to a changing climate, from hunting and gathering to farming and herding.},

One of the most significant and fossil-rich sites is Hadar, best known for the 1974 discovery of a 3.2-million-year-old partial skeleton, colloquially known as "Lucy" and assigned to the species Australopithecus afarensis. Renewed fieldwork at Hadar initiated in 1990 has significantly enlarged the Hadar A. afarensis collection, which now totals 362 specimens spanning 400,000 years from 3.4 to 3.0 million years ago. The discovery of male and female skulls provides vital knowledge for our understanding of A. afarensis. The oldest known co-occurrence of Oldowan tools and early Homo was also documented at Hadar in 2.33-million-year-old strata. With affinities to H. habilis, this discovery casts important light on to the origins of our own genus.},

Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions, and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses of this important clade.

Carnassials are the primary teeth associated with food processing, and hence difference in carnassial size may be a good indicator of difference in resource use. We suggest this pattern is consistent with competition in sympatry driving ecological character displacement, or competitive exclusion among ecologically similar species.

	abstract = {Commonness of organisms typically fluctuates through time, and understanding such fluctuations has long been an important part of ecological research. Studies at paleontological timescales provide a perspective on how changes in population size might affect community structure over millions of years. To overcome the obstacle that population size parameters such as abundance are difficult to detect in the fossil record, we here used fossil locality coverage to approximate changes in site occupancy in the Neogene of Europe over the course of 20 million years. Our aim was to examine whether the trophic structure of mammalian communities is maintained through time despite continuing environmental change. Ecomorphological grouping of fossils indicates that herbivore genera have low taxon resilience in that each genus has predominantly only one locality coverage peak before disappearance. Despite this continuous replacement of the most prevalent herbivore genera, the herbivore trophic group as a whole remains the largest and maintains a roughly constant share of locality coverage throughout the Neogene. The successive herbivore genera, however, show increasing adaptations to harshening environments, indicating shifting properties of niches while the overall trophic structure is conserved. Carnivores, dependent on primary productivity for food indirectly through their prey, show moderate lack of resilience. In contrast, in omnivores changes in locality coverage are close to random fluctuations.},

The method was established with the use of control measures of human rectal temperature and subsequent changes in fecal temperature over time. The method was then applied to temperature data collected from wild chimpanzee feces. In humans, we found good correspondence between the temperature estimated by the method and the actual rectal temperature that was measured (maximum deviation 0.22 C). The method was successfully applied and the average estimated temperature of the chimpanzees was 37.2 C. This simple-to-use field method reliably estimates the body temperature of wild chimpanzees and probably also other large mammals.},

	abstract = {We have documented elsewhere, and briefly reviewed here, the anomalously high species richness of browsing ungulates (hoofed mammals) in the mid Miocene (∼18–12 Ma) woodland savanna habitats of North America. In the mid Miocene these habitats supported substantially more brachydont (browsing) species than do any present-day savanna habitats. We present some preliminary data to show that such species-rich browser communities are not observed after the mid Miocene. The data also suggest that these mid Miocene browser communities and their subsequent disappearance may have been a global phenomenon. We then focus on possible explanations for these observations. We discuss the possibility that the high species numbers are a preservational artifact, and conclude that taphonomic factors are unlikely to be responsible for the level of species richness observed. We then consider various possible explanations for high species richness, including the unique aspects of climatic change (cooling, drying, increased seasonality), unique biotic interactions (the effects of competition, keystone herbivores, changes in predator pressure), and consider that none of these are fully consistent with the available data. The most likely explanation for the observed species-rich browser palaeocommunities is an elevated level of primary productivity, relative to the present day, within (at least some) mid Miocene grassland habitats. Such an increase in productivity could possibly have been the result of higher-than-present levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the mid Miocene, but this conflicts with current interpretations of geochemical evidence, and a satisfactory mechanism for the inferred increased primary productivity is an unresolved issue.},

	abstract = {Current global patterns of biodiversity result from processes that operate over both space and time and thus require an integrated macroecological and macroevolutionary perspective. Molecular time trees have advanced our understanding of the tempo and mode of diversification and have identified remarkable adaptive radiations across the tree of life. However, incomplete joint phylogenetic and geographic sampling has limited broad-scale inference. Thus, the relative prevalence of rapid radiations and the importance of their geographic settings in shaping global biodiversity patterns remain unclear. Here we present, analyse and map the first complete dated phylogeny of all 9,993 extant species of birds, a widely studied group showing many unique adaptations. We find that birds have undergone a strong increase in diversification rate from about 50 million years ago to the near present. This acceleration is due to a number of significant rate increases, both within songbirds and within other young and mostly temperate radiations including the waterfowl, gulls and woodpeckers. Importantly, species characterized with very high past diversification rates are interspersed throughout the avian tree and across geographic space. Geographically, the major differences in diversification rates are hemispheric rather than latitudinal, with bird assemblages in Asia, North America and southern South America containing a disproportionate number of species from recent rapid radiations. The contribution of rapidly radiating lineages to both temporal diversification dynamics and spatial distributions of species diversity illustrates the benefits of an inclusive geographical and taxonomical perspective. Overall, whereas constituent clades may exhibit slowdowns, the adaptive zone into which modern birds have diversified since the Cretaceous may still offer opportunities for diversification.},

Late Quaternary records indicate the modes and mechanisms of environmental variation and biotic responses at timescales of 101–104 years. Climatic changes of the late Quaternary have occurred continuously across a wide range of temporal scales, with the magnitude of change generally increasing with time span. Responses of terrestrial plant populations have ranged from tolerance in situ to moderate shifts in habitat to migration and/or extinction, depending on magnitudes and rates of environmental change. Species assemblages have been disaggregated and recombined, forming a changing array of vegetation patterns on the landscape. These patterns of change are characteristic of terrestrial plants and animals but may not be representative of all other life-forms or habitats. Complexity of response, particularly extent of species recombination, depends in part on the nature of the underlying environmental gradients and how they change through time. Environmental gradients in certain habitats may change in relatively simple fashion, allowing long-term persistence of species associations and spatial patterns. Consideration of late Quaternary climatic changes indicates that both the rate and magnitude of climatic changes anticipated for the coming century are unprecedented, presenting unique challenges to the biota of the planet.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Although metacommunity ecology has been a major field of research in the last decades, with both conceptual and empirical outputs, the analysis of the temporal dynamics of metacommunities has only emerged recently and still consists mostly of repeated static analyses. Here we propose a novel analysis framework to assess metacommunity processes using path analyses of spatial and temporal diversity turnovers. We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four real datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.

	abstract = {Limited dispersal is classically considered as a prerequisite for ecological specialization to evolve, such that generalists are expected to show greater dispersal propensity compared with specialists. However, when individuals choose habitats that maximize their performance instead of dispersing randomly, theory predicts dispersal with habitat choice to evolve in specialists, while generalists should disperse more randomly. We tested whether habitat choice is associated with thermal niche specialization using microcosms of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, a species that performs active dispersal. We found that thermal specialists preferred optimal habitats as predicted by theory, a link that should make specialists more likely to track suitable conditions under environmental changes than expected under the random dispersal assumption. Surprisingly, generalists also performed habitat choice but with a preference for suboptimal habitats. Since this result challenges current theory, we developed a metapopulation model to understand under which circumstances such a preference for suboptimal habitats should evolve. We showed that competition between generalists and specialists may favor a preference for niche margins in generalists under environmental variability. Our results demonstrate that the behavioral dimension of dispersal—here, habitat choice—fundamentally alters our predictions of how dispersal evolve with niche specialization, making dispersal behaviors crucial for ecological forecasting facing environmental changes.},

Strict-sense species selection occurs when those traits are emergent at the species level, such as geographic range or population size.

	abstract = {Abstract:  Scale and hierarchy must be incorporated into any conceptual framework for the study of macroevolution, i.e. evolution above the species level. Expansion of temporal and spatial scales reveals evolutionary patterns and processes that are virtually inaccessible to, and unpredictable from, short-term, localized observations. These larger-scale phenomena range from evolutionary stasis at the species level and the mosaic assembly of complex morphologies in ancestral forms to the non-random distribution in time and space of the origin of major evolutionary novelties, as exemplified by the Cambrian explosion and post-extinction recoveries of metazoans, and the preferential origin of major marine groups in onshore environments and tropical waters. Virtually all of these phenomena probably involve both ecological and developmental factors, but the integration of these components with macroevolutionary theory has only just begun. Differential survival and reproduction of units can occur at several levels within a biological hierarchy that includes DNA sequences, organisms, species and clades. Evolution by natural selection can occur at any level where there is heritable variation that affects birth and death of units by virtue of interaction with the environment. This dynamic can occur when selfish DNA sequences replicate disproportionately within genomes, when organisms enjoy fitness advantages within populations (classical Darwinian selection), when differential speciation or extinction occurs within clades owing to organismic properties (effect macroevolution), and when differential speciation or extinction occurs within clades owing to emergent, species-level properties (in the strict sense species selection). Operationally, emergent species-level properties such as geographical range can be recognized by testing whether their macroevolutionary effects are similar regardless of the different lower-level factors that produce them. Large-scale evolutionary trends can be driven by transformation of species, preferential production of species in a given direction, differential origination or extinction, or any combination of these; the potential for organismic traits to hitch-hike on other factors that promote speciation or damp extinction is high. Additional key attributes of macroevolutionary dynamics within biological hierarchies are that (1) hierarchical levels are linked by upward and downward causation, so that emergent properties at a focal level do not impart complete independence; (2) hierarchical effects are asymmetrical, so that dynamics at a given focal level need not propagate upwards, but will always cascade downwards; and (3) rates are generally, although not always, faster at lower hierarchical levels. Temporal and spatial patterns in the origin of major novelties and higher taxa are significantly discordant from those at the species and genus levels, suggesting complex hierarchical effects that remain poorly understood. Not only are many of the features promoting survivorship during background times ineffective during mass extinctions, but also they are replaced in at least some cases by higher-level, irreducible attributes such as clade-level geographical range. The incorporation of processes that operate across hierarchical levels and a range of temporal and spatial scales has expanded and enriched our understanding of evolution.},

Five synapomorphies are also evident between them and monophyletic Homo habilis/rudolfensis + H. erectus. Finally, a South African australopith + Homo clade is supported by four shared derived states, including identical LM1 cusp 7 expression.},

	abstract = {A new hypothesis, based on differences in the rates at which populations of competing species approach competitive equilibrium (reduction or exclusion of some species), is proposed to explain patterns of species diversity. The hypothesis assumes that most communities exist in a state of nonequilibrium where competitive equilibrium is prevented by periodic population reductions and environmental fluctuations. When competitive equilibrium is prevented, a dynamic balance may be established between the rate of competitive displacement and the frequency of population reduction, which results in a stable level of diversity. Under conditions of infrequent reductions, an increase in the population growth rates of competitors generally results in decreased diversity. This model clarifies an underlying pattern of variation in diversity and points out the common elements of previous hypotheses. Rather than arguing that either competition, predation, or productivity control diversity, it demonstrates that all of these may contribute to the same basic mechanism. In doing so, it not only explains the correlations of the other hypotheses with patterns of diversity, but also explains the exceptions that these hypotheses could not explain. This hypothesis may be applied to variations of diversity both on a latitudinal gradient and within specific regions.},

	abstract = {Homo erectus was the first human lineage to disperse widely throughout the Old World, the only hominin in Asia through much of the Pleistocene, and was likely ancestral to H. sapiens. The demise of this taxon remains obscure because of uncertainties regarding the geological age of its youngest populations. In 1996, some of us co-published electron spin resonance (ESR) and uranium series (U-series) results indicating an age as young as 35–50 ka for the late H. erectus sites of Ngandong and Sambungmacan and the faunal site of Jigar (Indonesia). If correct, these ages favor an African origin for recent humans who would overlap with H. erectus in time and space. Here, we report 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating analyses and new ESR/U-series age estimates from the “20 m terrace" at Ngandong and Jigar. Both data sets are internally consistent and provide no evidence for reworking, yet they are inconsistent with one another. The 40Ar/39Ar analyses give an average age of 546±12 ka (sd±5 se) for both sites, the first reliable radiometric indications of a middle Pleistocene component for the terrace. Given the technical accuracy and consistency of the analyses, the argon ages represent either the actual age or the maximum age for the terrace and are significantly older than previous estimates. Most of the ESR/U-series results are older as well, but the oldest that meets all modeling criteria is 143 ka+20/−17. Most samples indicated leaching of uranium and likely represent either the actual or the minimum age of the terrace. Given known sources of error, the U-series results could be consistent with a middle Pleistocene age. However, the ESR and 40Ar/39Ar ages preclude one another. Regardless, the age of the sites and hominins is at least bracketed between these estimates and is older than currently accepted.},

Here we use likelihood methods to fit an expanded set of evolutionary models to a large compilation of ancestor–descendant series of populations from the fossil record. In addition to the standard three models, we assess more complex models with punctuations and shifts from one evolutionary mode to another. As in previous studies, we find that stasis is common in the fossil record, as is a strict version of stasis that entails no real evolutionary changes. Incidence of directional evolution is relatively low (13\%), but higher than in previous studies because our analytical approach can more sensitively detect noisy trends. Complex evolutionary models are often favored, overwhelmingly so for sequences comprising many samples. This finding is consistent with evolutionary dynamics that are, in reality, more complex than any of the models we consider. Furthermore, the timing of shifts in evolutionary dynamics varies among traits measured from the same series. Finally, we use our empirical collection of evolutionary sequences and a long and highly resolved proxy for global climate to inform simulations in which traits adaptively track temperature changes over time. When realistically calibrated, we find that this simple model can reproduce important aspects of our paleontological results. We conclude that observed paleontological patterns, including the prevalence of stasis, need not be inconsistent with adaptive evolution, even in the face of unstable physical environments.},

	abstract = {The nature of evolutionary changes recorded by the fossil record has long been controversial, with particular disagreement concerning the relative frequency of gradual change versus stasis within lineages. Here, I present a large-scale, statistical survey of evolutionary mode in fossil lineages. Over 250 sequences of evolving traits were fit by using maximum likelihood to three evolutionary models: directional change, random walk, and stasis. Evolution in these traits was rarely directional; in only 5\% of fossil sequences was directional evolution the most strongly supported of the three modes of change. The remaining 95\% of sequences were divided nearly equally between random walks and stasis. Variables related to body size were significantly less likely than shape traits to experience stasis. This finding is in accord with previous suggestions that size may be more evolutionarily labile than shape and is consistent with some but not all of the mechanisms proposed to explain evolutionary stasis. In general, similar evolutionary patterns are observed across other variables, such as clade membership and temporal resolution, but there is some evidence that directional change in planktonic organisms is more frequent than in benthic organisms. The rarity with which directional evolution was observed in this study corroborates a key claim of punctuated equilibria and suggests that truly directional evolution is infrequent or, perhaps more importantly, of short enough duration so as to rarely register in paleontological sampling.},

However, the mechanism linking energy with richness is rarely specified and predictions of secondary patterns consistent with energy-constrained richness are lacking. Here, we lay out the necessary and sufficient assumptions of a causal relationship linking energy gradients to richness gradients. We then describe an eco-evolutionary simulation model that combines spatially explicit diversification with trait evolution, resource availability and assemblage-level carrying capacities. Our model identified patterns in richness and phylogenetic structure expected when a spatial gradient in energy availability determines the number of individuals supported in a given area. A comparison to patterns under alternative scenarios, in which fundamental assumptions behind energetic explanations were violated, revealed patterns that are useful for evaluating the importance of energetic constraints in empirical systems. We use a data set on rockfish (genus Sebastes) from the northeastern Pacific to show how empirical data can be coupled with model predictions to evaluate the role of energetic constraints in generating observed richness gradients.},

	abstract = {Most studies examining continental-to-global patterns of species richness rely on the overlaying of extent-of-occurrence range maps. Because a species does not occur at all locations within its geographic range, range-map-derived data represent actual distributional patterns only at some relatively coarse and undefined resolution. With the increasing availability of high-resolution climate and land-cover data, broad-scale studies are increasingly likely to estimate richness at high resolutions. Because of the scale dependence of most ecological phenomena, a significant mismatch between the presumed and actual scale of ecological data may arise. This may affect conclusions regarding basic drivers of diversity and may lead to errors in the identification of diversity hotspots. Here, we examine avian range maps of 834 bird species in conjunction with geographically extensive survey data sets on two continents to determine the spatial resolutions at which range-map data actually characterize species occurrences and patterns of species richness. At resolutions less than 2° (≈200 km), range maps overestimate the area of occupancy of individual species and mischaracterize spatial patterns of species richness, resulting in up to two-thirds of biodiversity hotspots being misidentified. The scale dependence of range-map accuracy poses clear limitations on broad-scale ecological analyses and conservation assessments. We suggest that range-map data contain less information than is generally assumed and provide guidance about the appropriate scale of their use.},

A maximum likelihood estimator of phylogeny is derived using an explicit mathematical model of fossil preservation. The method assumes that fossil preservations within lineages follow an independent Poisson process, but can be extended to include other preservation models. The performance of the method was examined using Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of the maximum likelihood estimator of topology increases with an increase in the preservation rate. The method is biased, like other methods of phylogeny estimation, when the rate of fossil preservation is low; estimated trees tend to be more asymmetrical than the true tree. The method appears to perform well as a tree rooting criterion even when preservation rates are low. We suggest several possible extensions of the method to address other questions about the nature of fossil preservation and the process of speciation and extinction over time and space.},

Three important characteristics of cumulative technological evolution are: (i) the diversification of tool design; (ii) cumulative change; and (iii) high–fidelity social transmission. We present evidence that crows have diversified and cumulatively changed the design of their pandanus tools. In 2000 we carried out an intensive survey in New Caledonia to establish the geographical variation in the manufacture of these tools. We documented the shapes of 5550 tools from 21 sites throughout the range of pandanus tool manufacture. We found three distinct pandanus tool designs: wide tools, narrow tools and stepped tools. The lack of ecological correlates of the three tool designs and their different, continuous and overlapping geographical distributions make it unlikely that they evolved independently. The similarities in the manufacture method of each design further suggest that pandanus tools have gone through a process of cumulative change from a common historical origin. We propose a plausible scenario for this rudimentary cumulative evolution.},

	abstract = {Aim  To investigate explanations for the maintenance of a positive spatial species richness–human population density correlation at broad scales, despite the negative impact of humans on species richness. These are (hypotheses 1–4): (1) human activities that create a habitat mosaic and (2) a more favourable climate, and (3) adequate conservation measures (e.g. sufficient natural habitat), maintain the positive species richness–human density correlation; or (4) the full range of human densities decrease the slope of the correlation without changing its form. Location  South Africa. Methods  Avian species richness data from atlas distribution maps and human population density data derived from 2001 census results were converted to a quarter-degree resolution. We investigated the number of land transformation types (anthropogenic habitat heterogeneity), irrigated area (increasing productivity), and other covarying factors (e.g. primary productivity) as predictors of species richness. We compared species richness–human density relationships among regions with different amounts of natural habitat, and investigated whether the full range of human densities decrease species richness in relation to primary productivity. Results  Hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 were supported. Human densities and activities that increase habitat heterogeneity and productivity are important beneficial factors to common species, but not to rare species. The species richness–human density relationship persists only at low land transformation levels, and no significant relationship exists at higher levels. For common species, the relationship becomes non-significant at lower land transformation levels than for rare species. Main conclusions  The persistence of the species richness–human density relationship depends mostly on the amount of remaining natural habitat. In addition, certain human activities benefit especially common species. Common species seem to be more flexible than rare species in response to human activity and habitat loss.},

	abstract = {Trait variation and covariation are understood to influence the response of populations to natural selection on generational time scales, but their role, if any, in shaping long-term macroevolutionary divergence is still unclear. The present study uses the rich fossil record of the ostracode genus Poseidonamicus to reconstruct in great detail the evolutionary history of a set of landmark-based morphometric characters. This reconstruction included two kinds of evolutionary inferences: ancestor–descendant transitions among populations repeatedly sampled at the same location and divergence between lineages measured as independent contrasts on a phylogeny. This reconstructed history was then used to test if evolutionary changes were concentrated in directions (traits or combinations of traits) with high phenotypic variance. Two different statistics of association between evolution and variation tested the null hypothesis that evolutionary changes occur in random directions with respect to trait variability. The first of these measured the similarity between the directions of evolutionary change and the axis of maximum variance, and the second measured the degree to which evolutionary changes were concentrated in directions of high phenotypic variation. Randomization tests indicated that both kinds of evolutionary inferences (ancestor–descendant and phylogenetic contrasts) occurred preferentially in directions of high phenotypic variance (and close to the axis of maximal variation), suggesting that within-population variation can structure long-term divergence. This effect decayed after a few million years, but at least for one metric, never disappeared completely. These results are consistent with Schluter's genetic constraints model in which evolutionary trajectories on adaptive landscapes are deflected by variation within and covariation among traits.},

	abstract = {The fossil calvaria known as the Mojokerto child's skull was discovered in 1936, but uncertainties have persisted about its paleoenvironmental context and geological age because of difficulties in relocating the discovery site. Past relocation efforts were hindered by inaccuracies in old base maps, intensive post-1930s agricultural terracing, and new tree and brush growth. Fortunately geologic cross sections and site photographs from 1936-1938—not fully utilized in past relocation fieldwork—closely circumscribe site geography and geology. These documents match the conditions at just one sandstone outcrop. It is situated on the southern margin of a topographic nose at the upper end of a ∼18 m-wide gully (∼0663760 m E, 9183430 m N, UTM Zone 49M), ∼15 m southeast of the Kumai et al. (1985) relocation. The relocated discovery bed is ∼3.3 m of fossiliferous pebbly sandstone, a river-channel deposit cut into tuffaceous mudstone. The sandstone and mudstone beds correspond to original site descriptions. Pebbly sandstone is also found within the skull.

The calvaria is well-preserved and taphonomically similar to large and fragile specimens found among several hundred vertebrate fossils excavated from the sandstone in 2001-2002. Since no well-preserved fossils were found intact at the surface of the sandstone, the good condition of the Mojokerto skull suggests that it was buried fully when discovered. The relocated hominin bed is the uppermost fluvial sandstone of a marine-deltaic sequence in the upper Pucangan Formation. The Mojokerto child probably died along the ancient seacoast, judging from the large extent of the deltaic facies and evidence that the calvaria experienced minimal transport. The relocated discovery bed is ∼20 m stratigraphically above the horizon from which the widely cited 1.81 ± 0.04 Ma 40Ar/39Ar date for the skull (Swisher et al., 1994, Science 263, 1118) was obtained. Additional field and laboratory results will be required to determine the skull's age.},

Unlike other measures of species compositional turnover, zeta diversity partitioning quantifies the complete set of diversity components for multiple assemblages, comprehensively representing the spatial structure of multispecies distributions. To illustrate the application and ecological value of zeta diversity, we show how it scales with sample number, grain, and distance. Zeta diversity reconciles several different biodiversity patterns, including the species accumulation curve, the species-area relationship, multispecies occupancy patterns, and scaling of species endemism. Exponential and power-law forms of zeta diversity are associated with stochastic versus niche assembly processes. Zeta diversity may provide new insights on biodiversity patterns, the processes driving them, and their response to environmental change.},

Allometricians, after much debate and error, derived satisfactory interpretations for the parameters of this function. The coefficient proved difficult because it is not invariant under change of scale and often makes no biological sense as the value of y (number of species) when x equals 1 unit. Ecologists have fallen into the same traps that plagued allometricians 30 yr ago, but have been unaware that the problems had been solved by their sister subdiscipline. Coefficients of power functions should not be neglected or ignored by ecologists (more often than not, they are not reported at all). When slopes are constant in families of related curves-a common situation in the species-area literature where slopes are so often near 0.25-ratios of coefficients are constant at all values of x (area): They record a size-independent invariant within a system. I present several invariants, previously unrecognized or identified more circuitously in other ways.},

Although they have had a controversial history, null models are widely used as statistical tools by ecologists and biogeographers. Three active research fronts in null model analysis include biodiversity measures, species co-occurrence patterns, and macroecology. In the analysis of biodiversity, ecologists have used random sampling procedures such as rarefaction to adjust for differences in abundance and sampling effort. In the analysis of species co-occurrence and assembly rules, null models have been used to detect the signature of species interactions. However, controversy persists over the details of computer algorithms used for randomizing presence-absence matrices. Finally, in the newly emerging discipline of macroecology, null models can be used to identify constraining boundaries in bivariate scatterplots of variables such as body size, range size, and population density. Null models provide specificity and flexibility in data analysis that is often not possible with conventional statistical tests.},

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category–subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods – both sample-based and individual-based – allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

However, this earlier work involved only a few relative abundance distributions (RADs), very limited gradients of species richness, or evenness indices, such as Pielou's index, that were not defined in relation to a precise, coherent set of axioms. We show that for very different theoretical RADs, a relationship between evenness indices and species richness does exist and is strong—at least for some RADs and/or when species richness is under 20. Furthermore, this relationship is mostly negative, which contradicts some previous studies. We also show that, for the very uneven RADs we tested, evenness indices depend even more on species richness than diversity indices do. Finally, we discuss the philosophy behind the analysis of evenness-richness relationships within and between RADs, as well as the interest of correcting evenness indices for species richness when species richness varies, especially with many values under 20.},

Here, we report results of analyses of the evolutionary dynamics of post-Palaeozoic crinoid genera spanning a time interval between 250 and 70 Myr. We show that crinoids reached their Mesozoic peak of genus-level richness during the Late Jurassic. We also document a major reorganization of different ecological crinoid groups in the Mesozoic. More specifically, the diversity of sessile forms generally increased towards the mid-Mesozoic but decreased significantly starting in the Cretaceous, whereas the number of motile crinoid genera increased linearly during the Mesozoic. The possible role of biotic and abiotic factors in crinoid evolution is discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Populations unable to evolve to selectively favored states are constrained. Genetic constraints occur when additive genetic variance in selectively favored directions is absent (absolute constraints) or present but small (quantitative constraints). Quantitative—unlike absolute—constraints are presumed surmountable given time. This ignores that a population might become extinct before reaching the favored state, in which case demography effectively converts a quantitative into an absolute constraint. Here, we derive criteria for predicting when such conversions occur. We model the demography and evolution of populations subject to optimizing selection that experience either a single shift or a constant change in the optimum. In the single‐shift case, we consider whether a population can evolve significantly without declining or else declines temporarily while avoiding low sizes consistent with high extinction risk. We analyze when populations in constantly changing environments evolve sufficiently to ensure long‐term growth. From these, we derive formulas for critical levels of genetic variability that define demography‐caused absolute constraints. The formulas depend on estimable properties of fitness, population size, or environmental change rates. Each extends to selection on multivariate traits. Our criteria define the nearly null space of a population’s G matrix, the set of multivariate directions effectively inaccessible to it via adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {Synthesis Despite theoretical criticisms, the ubiquity of linear relationships between local and regional species richness has long been used to justify it as a valid framework to conclude that local communities are not saturated with species. However, we reanalyzed published studies with a new unbiased method and found no prevalence of linear relationships and more than 40\% of misclassifications, including textbook examples. We thus conclude that the prevailing argument in favor of associating a valid ecological interpretation to local–regional species richness plots, its ubiquity, is not sustained, and that ecologists could use for instance metacommunity theory to make inference on the strength of local and regional processes. Identifying the relative importance of regional and local processes to local species diversity is a central issue to many questions in basic and applied ecology. One widely-used method is to plot local species richness against its regional richness to infer whether regional or local processes determine local diversity. However, this method increases the tendency to find regional prevalence as suggested by a recent simulation. We reanalyzed studies in the literature with an unbiased method and found no prevalence of either regional or local processes. In addition, almost 40\% of the studies and 50\% of the ecology textbook examples using the traditional method were misclassified. Our findings reinforce the need of alternative, novel tools identified by for instance metacommunity theory to go beyond the studies of local–regional relationships in the ecological literature that focus on the interdependence of regional and local processes.},

We find that the dynamics of species richness differ significantly from a random process, and that these nonrandom dynamics occur largely within the most speciose guild. Finally, we propose a general framework for assessing the importance of species compensation in maintaining biodiversity within local communities.

	abstract = {Adaptive radiation is the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and role-specific adaptations within a lineage. Recently, some researchers have begun to use ‘adaptive radiation’ or ‘radiation’ as synonymous with ‘explosive species diversification’. This essay aims to clarify distinctions between these concepts, and the related ideas of geographic speciation, sexual selection, key innovations, key landscapes and ecological keys. Several examples are given to demonstrate that adaptive radiation and explosive diversification are not the same phenomenon, and that focusing on explosive diversification and the analysis of phylogenetic topology ignores much of the rich biology associated with adaptive radiation, and risks generating confusion about the nature of the evolutionary forces driving species diversification. Some ‘radiations’ involve bursts of geographic speciation or sexual selection, rather than adaptive diversification; some adaptive radiations have little or no effect on speciation, or even a negative effect. Many classic examples of ‘adaptive radiation’ appear to involve effects driven partly by geographic speciation, species’ dispersal abilities, and the nature of extrinsic dispersal barriers; partly by sexual selection; and partly by adaptive radiation in the classical sense, including the origin of traits and invasion of adaptive zones that result in decreased diversification rates but add to overall diversity.},

These fossils contribute to our understanding human evolution, and the associated fauna provide new information about the distribution and variability of Pleistocene mammals in eastern Africa. The contributors are all active researchers who worked on the paleontology and geology of these unique deposits. Here they have combined their disparate efforts into a single volume, making the original research results accessible to both the specialist and the general reader. The volume synthesizes environmental backdrop and anatomical detail to open an unparalleled window on the African Pleistocene and its inhabitants.},

Using both generation means and triple-test-cross analyses, we investigated the genetic architecture of wing size (an indicator of body size) and wing shape in a naturally occurring body size cline. For wing size, we found significant epistatic genetic variance and evidence of past directional selection for increased body size. While wing shape also exhibits significant epistatic genetic variance, there was no indication of directional selection, suggesting instead a history of optimizing selection. Our results support the idea that epistatic variance may be more common in natural populations than was once suspected. Also, our results suggest substantial directional selection on wing size but not shape.},

We estimated population sizes through time from a set of globally distributed whole mitochondrial genomes, after separating lineages associated with agricultural populations from those associated with hunter-gatherers. The coalescent-based analysis revealed strong evidence for distinct demographic expansions in Europe, southeastern Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa within the past 10,000 y. Estimates of the timing of population growth based on genetic data correspond neatly to dates for the initial origins of agriculture derived from archaeological evidence. Comparisons of rates of population growth through time reveal that the invention of agriculture facilitated a fivefold increase in population growth relative to more ancient expansions of hunter-gatherers.},

These changes are diachronic in the various areas, as are other faunal changes (in successive order, in Lake Turkana basin: West Turkana, Omo, Koobi Fora). High diversity is associated with a higher number of abundant species, whereas the subsequent, less diverse, assemblages have only 1 or 2 very abundant species. The decrease in diversity might be a consequence of the latest Pliocene global cooling, resulting in a decrease in primary productivity and other related parameters. There is, however, some evidence that more favourable conditions were restored afterwards.},

	abstract = {Recent geologic study shows that all hominins and nearly all other published mammalian fossils from Paleontological Collection Area 123, Koobi Fora, Kenya, derive from levels between the KBS Tuff (1.87 ± 0.02 Ma) and the Lower Ileret Tuff (1.53 ± 0.01 Ma). More specifically, the fossils derive from 53 m of section below the Lower Ileret Tuff, an interval in which beds vary markedly laterally, especially those units containing molluscs and algal stromatolites. The upper Burgi Member ({\textasciitilde}2.00–1.87 Ma) crops out only in the southwestern part of Area 123. Adjacent Area 110 contains larger exposures of the member, and there the KBS Tuff is preserved as an airfall ash in lacustrine deposits and also as a fluvially redeposited ash. We observed no mammalian fossils in situ in this member in Area 123, but surface specimens have been documented in some monographic treatments.

Fossil hominins from Area 123 were attributed to strata above the KBS Tuff in the 1970s, but later they were assigned to strata below the KBS Tuff (now called the upper Burgi Member). This study definitively places the Area 123 hominins in the KBS Member. Most of these hominins are between 1.60 and 1.65 myr in age, but the youngest may date to only 1.53 Ma, and the oldest, to 1.75 Ma. All are 0.15–0.30 myr younger than previously estimated. The new age estimates, in conjunction with published taxonomic attributions of fossils, suggest that at least two species of Homo coexisted in the region along with A. boisei until at least 1.65 Ma. Comparison of crania KNM-ER 1813 and KNM-ER 1470, which were believed to be of comparable age, is at the focus of the debate over whether Homo habilis sensu lato is in fact composed of two species: Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis. These two crania are separated in time by ∼0.25 myr, and therefore, arguments for their conspecificity no longer need to confront the issue of unusually high contemporaneous variation within a single species.},

Basin architecture depends upon a complex interaction between the three-dimensional evolution of basin linkage through fault propagation, the evolution of drainage and drainage catchments and the effects of changes in climate and sea/lake level. In particular, the processes of fault propagation, growth, linkage and death are major tectonic controls on basin architecture. Current theoretical and experimental models of fault linkage and the direction of fault growth can be tested using observational evidence from the earliest stages of rift development. Basin linkage by burial or breaching of crossover basement ridges is the dominant process whereby hydrologically closed rifts evolve into open ones. Nontectonic effects arising from climate, sea or lake level change are responsible for major changes in basin-scale sedimentation patterns. Major gaps in our understanding of rift basins remain because of current inadequacies in sediment, fault and landscape dating.},

The objective of this book is to explore the nature of rarity, its complexity if you like, from one particular perspective on what rarity is. Primarily, it is an opportunity to review, to synthesize, and to question. The book is an attempt to draw together a vast body of literature, to extract from it some general principles, and to raise question marks over areas the founda­ tions of which appear to be either absent or crumbling. A perusal of prefaces suggests that they often dwell as long upon what a book is not about, as upon what it does concern. True to such a tradition, I should state that this is specifically not a book about conservation, although in some quarters anything about rarity is viewed as something about conser­ vation. Nor does it contain more than a passing reference to the undoubtedly important issues of the role of genetics in rarity. Examples have been drawn from a wide variety of taxa. They are, nonethe­ less, somewhat depauperate in cases from marine systems. In part this bias results from the unevenness of my familiarity with the literature, in part it perhaps also reflects differences in the questions asked and approaches to the study of communities and assemblages in terrestrial and marine systems.},

Although species-occupancy distributions (SODs) and species-area relationships (SARs) arise from the two marginal sums of the same presence/absence matrices, the two biodiversity patterns are usually explored independently. Here, we aim to unify the two patterns for isolate-based data by constraining the SAR to conserve information from the SOD.


Location

Widespread.


Methods

Focusing on the power-model SAR, we first developed a constrained form that conserved the total number of occupancies from the SOD. Next, we developed an additive-constrained SAR that conserves the entire shape of the SOD within the power-model SAR function, using a single parameter (the slope of the endemics-area relationship). We then relate this additive-constrained SAR to multiple-sites similarity measures, based on a probabilistic view of Sørensen similarity. We extend the constrained and additive-constrained SAR framework to 23 published SAR functions. We compare the fit of the original and constrained forms of 12 SAR functions using 154 published data sets, covering various spatial scales, taxa and systems.


Main conclusions

In all 23 SAR functions, the constrained form had one parameter less than the original form. In all 154 data sets the model with the highest weight based on the corrected Akaike's information criteria (wAICc) had a constrained form. The constrained form received higher wAICc than the original form in 98.79\% of valid pairwise cases, approaching the wAICc expected under identical log-likelihood. Our work suggests, both theoretically and empirically, that all SAR functions may have one unnecessary parameter, which can be excluded from the function without reduction in goodness-of-fit. The more parsimonious constrained forms are also easier to interpret as they reflect the probability of a randomly chosen occupancy to be found in an isolate. The additive-constrained SARs accounts for two complimentary turn-over components of occupancies: turnover between species and turnover between sites.},

	abstract = {Patterns preserved in the fossil record are of the highest importance in addressing questions about long-term evolutionary processes, yet both the description of pattern and its translation into process can be difficult. With respect to gradual phyletic change, we know that randomly generated sequences may exhibit characteristics of a “trend” apparent patterns, therefore, must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, even when the claim of a gradual trend can be statistically justified, interpretation of the underlying mechanisms may be challenging. Given that we can observe populations changing rapidly over tens or hundreds of years, it is now more difficult to explain instances of geologically gradual (as opposed to punctuated) change. Here we describe morphologic change in two bivalve lineages from the late Miocene Lake Pannon. We evaluate change according to the model-based methods of Hunt. Both lineages exhibit size increases and shape changes over an interval of nearly 4 million years. Size and two shape variables in the conjungens lineage are best fit by a model of directional evolution; remaining shape variables mostly conform to unbiased random walks. Body-size evolution in the diprosopum lineage is also significantly directional but all shape variables are best fit by the unbiased random walk model; the small number of sampling intervals available for this lineage (n = 6) makes determination of the actual pattern more difficult. Model-fitting results indicate that the parallel trajectories of increasing log shell height over time in the two lineages can be accounted for by an underlying trend shared by both lineages, suggesting that the size increases may be a shared response to the same cause. The pace of phenotypic change, measured as Lynch's Δ, is slower than the neutral expectation for all size and shape traits. Our examples illustrate well the paradox of gradualism; the sequences exhibit significant directional morphological evolution, but rates of change as measured over the long-term are apparently too slow for directional selection or even drift to be the cause. Viewing long-term phenotypic evolution in terms of populations tracking peaks on adaptive landscapes is useful in this context. Such a view allows for intervals of directional selection (during times of peak movement–resulting in the overall trends we can detect) interspersed with intervals of stasis (during times of peak stability–resulting in overall changes that appear to proceed more slowly than the neutral expectation). The paradox of gradualism thus reduces to (1) peak movements and their drivers, which are not restricted in rate as are population-genetic drivers, and (2) the maintenance of stasis, on which no consensus exists. We can identify no environmental parameter in the central European Neogene that exhibits consistent change across the interval of gradual morphologic change. It may be that in Lake Pannon the long-term persistence of generally ameliorating conditions (plentiful resources and habitat space, few predators or competitors) resulted in geologically slow but consistent peak shifts, which in turn facilitated size increase and shape change in these lineages.},

Desert sediments are frequently associated with continental rifts or aulacogens in the stratigraphic record. In this circumstance, rift structure and the timing and magnitude of tectonic events exert an overriding control on the distribution and character of alluvial sediments. Recent advances in the understanding of rift structure make a reassessment of ideas on the relationship between faulting, drainage patterns and alluvial facies distribution timely. Existing models of symmetrical graben with large alluvial fans shed from the footwalls of planar, normal boundary faults do not accord with observations in recent rifts. For example, half-graben dominate the structure throughout the African rifts. Boundary faults are mostly listric and the associated back-tilting of fault-blocks, combined with the doming that frequently accompanies rifting, causes back-shedding of rivers away from the basins. Alluvial fan development at fault scarps is, therefore, limited. The maximum observed fan radius in Lake Turkana is, for example, only 8 km, or 10\% of the half-graben width at that point. The supply of sediment to rift basins can be dominated by axial rivers (eg Sugata R. flowing into L. Logipi in Kenya, the Awash R. of the Afar in Ethiopia, and the Rhine R. flowing through the Rhine rift), but there are a surprising number of basins that do not have major axial inputs (eg L. Tanganyika and L. Malawi in East Africa and L. Baikal in Siberia). In these cases, the importance of smaller, but more numerous rivers draining across the roll-over becomes obvious. These rivers are subjected to rapid changes in base level and longitudinal gradient: movement of a boundary fault alters the geometry of the lake basin and base-level falls as the lake adjusts. This is accompanied by the aggradation of coarse alluvial deposits across the roll-over. Clast size gradients in these deposits are well defined for the region between the basin margin and the main depocentre, with typical measured values of −3 mm km−1. During the long, intervening periods of tectonic quiescence these and other deposits are reworked and redistributed downslope and offshore. Deltas build out into the lake, but microstratigraphy reveals that they are not of the classic Gilbert type. Short- and long-term fluctuations in lake level cause large-scale migration of the shoreline so that lake muds and alluvial sands are interdigitated over many kilometres in sequences which vary from a few metres to tens of metres in thickness. A synthesis of detailed work carried out on the sedimentology and geomorphology of a modern rift of the common half-graben type provides a new model of sedimentation that will prove useful in interpreting ancient deposits with hydrocarbon potential.},

Further, we find that the volumes of human prefrontal gray and white matter match the expected volumes for the number of neurons in the gray matter and for the number of other cells in the white matter compared with other primate species. These results indicate that prefrontal cortical expansion in human evolution happened along the same allometric trajectory as for other primate species, without modification of the distribution of neurons across its surface or of the volume of the underlying white matter. We thus propose that the most distinctive feature of the human prefrontal cortex is its absolute number of neurons, not its relative volume.},

We imposed four different levels of random extinctions on local patches and monitored changes in the metacommunity through time. We found that near-steady state patterns of community variability developed relatively rapidly (within 9 colonization-extinction cycles) and that increased extinction rate produced altered patterns of community regulation by reducing environmental control and increasing spatial and stochastic effects.

	abstract = {[There has been a protracted debate about whether the fossil record supports very slow and gradual change, or rapid change followed by stasis (punctuated equilibria). If the latter becomes a comprehensive world-view, it influences observation in the same way that the gradualistic paradigm was once claimed to, so that gradualistic change becomes perceptually 'invisible'. The unbiased observer may well see both processes operating, with a dominance of punctuated equilibria. Gradualistic change can help to confirm the reality of punctuational change if they are found together in the same rock sections: far from being in opposition the processes can be complementary. Punctuated equilibrium fits comfortably into the Neo-Darwinian paradigm. Paradoxically, if gradualism really exists its excessive slowness poses real problems for explanations based on natural selection, and 'drift' might provide a better explanation of such change.]},

Newsome and Catling (1979) produced a habitat complexity score, made up of components important to heathland small mammal species, and used it to analyse faunal habitat relations in lowland and highland heaths, and changes in small mammal faunas in pyric succession.},

Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity–disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity–disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict.

When applied to the localities of a set of European Neogene land mammal taxa, spectral ordering relies almost entirely on the most common genera, depends on connectivity more than on length of taxon lists, and is robust to noise from rarer and less connected taxa. The spectral coefficients for localities are highly correlated with known geochronological ages. Although elementary compared with more sophisticated biochronological tools, spectral ordering allows a fast and standardized way to generate biochronological ordering of localities when other information than faunal lists is lacking. Compared with the conventional mammal Neogene (MN) units, spectral ordering of localities appears to lack distinct temporal boundaries in taxon content and render a much lower count of Lazarus events. If, as seems to be the case, biochronology depends mainly on the most common taxa and if evolutionary change is also most clearly reflected in them, then the main evolutionary patterns should be detectable at a modest level of sampling.},

	abstract = {Abstract: A long‐standing observation in community ecology is that the scaling of species richness, as exemplified by species‐area curves, differs on local and regional scales. This decoupling of scales may be largely due to sampling processes (the increasing constraint imposed by sampling fewer individuals at fine scales), as distinct from ecological processes, such as environmental heterogeneity, that operate across scales. Removal of the sampling constraint from fine‐scale richness estimates should yield species‐area curves that behave like those of the regions in which they are embedded, but an effective method for this removal has not been available. We suggest an approach that incorporates the manner in which small areas accumulate species over time as a way to remove the signature of sampling processes from fine‐scale species‐area curves. We report for three species‐rich grasslands from two continents how local plant species richness is distributed through time at multiple, nested spatial scales, and we ask whether sampling‐corrected curves reflect the spatial scaling of richness of each larger floristic province. Our analysis suggests that fine‐scale values of richness are highly constrained by sampling processes, but once these constraints are removed, the spatial scaling of species richness is consistent from the scale of individuals to that of an entire province.},

We examined fine-scale species–area relationships using the extensive database of the Carolina Vegetation Survey (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, USA), including 1472 plots wherein vascular plant richness was recorded for each of six subplot sizes regularly spaced on a log10 scale, from 0.01 to 1000 m2. Contrary to prevailing theory, our data closely and consistently fit an Arrhenius (power law) species–area model, echoing broader-scale patterns. Species accumulation rate (Z) values fell within a narrow range (95\% between 0.2 and 0.5) despite a 30-fold range in 1000-m2 richness. When we added regional- and global-scale richness estimates to our results, a Preston-type triphasic curve emerged. We suggest that (1) fine-scale species–area relationships are remarkably consistent and (2) full-scale species–area curves reveal scale dependencies in diversity data that are not accounted for by current species–area theory.},

	abstract = {The temporal association of hominid evolution with a period of global climatic instability and cooling is suggestive of a causal relationship. A number of authors have proposed a climatic forcing model for the timing and nature of evolutionary changes in human evolution during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (5-3 Mya), such as the appearance of new taxa, and by inference only a limited role for continuous evolutionary change in response to inter- and intra-specific competition at the local level. A major problem with such models is that both climatic change and hominid evolution are now recognised as complex with numerous events. By splitting climatic change as revealed in deep sea cores into a number of distinct attributes (temperature, stability and variability) and examining the relationship of each to the appearance, diversity and disappearance of hominid taxa it is possible to investigate more closely the effect of climatic change on hominid evolution. It is shown that the effect of climatic change can be observed in relation to extinction events, but that there is no significant relationship with the first appearance of hominid taxa. This implies that the mechanism by which climate influences evolution is primarily through extinction, and that further factors dependent upon local competitive conditions play a significant part in the appearance of new taxa.},

	abstract = {Our assessment of morphological diversity is influenced by morphological extremes and therefore depends on sample size (taxonomic richness). Rarefaction predicts the morphological diversity that would probably be observed in a sample of reduced size, thereby allowing both compensation for differences in sample size that may be strictly preservational, and analysis of diversity structure, that is, the relationship between morphological and taxonomic diversity. Middle and Late Cambrian trilobites exhibit a diversity structure characterized by many variations on a few morphological themes. In contrast, Middle and Late Ordovician trilobites occupy a larger range of morphospace per unit of species richness. Diversity structure in the Devonian is similar to that in the Middle and Late Ordovician, but the magnitude of morphological diversity is lower in the Devonian, as many fewer species are observed. For blastoids, different aspects of morphological diversity (range of morphospace occupied, number of character states possessed, and number of different regions in morphospace occupied) exhibit different relationships to taxonomic richness. In all cases Permian blastoids are characterized by a diversity structure in which morphological diversity per unit of taxonomic richness is greater than for Devonian blastoids. Changes in morphological diversity in fissiculate blastoids appear to reflect evolution of continuous variation in thecal morphology more than changes in the number of character states. Saunders and Swan's data on Namurian ammonoids illustrate some significant differences in diversity structure among stratigraphic levels, but many apparent differences in morphological diversity are consistent with the possibility that they reflect the sampling of different numbers of species from the same underlying diversity structure. Rarefaction curves are also presented for idealized increases and decreases in diversity, and these are compared to some of the observed changes in trilobites, blastoids, and ammonoids.},

	abstract = {Three homogeneous models of species origination and extinction are used to assess the probability that ancestor-descendant pairs are preserved in the fossil record. In the model of cladogenetic budding, a species can persist after it branches and can therefore have multiple direct descendants. In the bifurcation model, a species branches to give rise to two distinct direct descendants, itself terminating in the process. In the model of phyletic transformation, a species gives rise to a single direct descendant without branching, itself terminating in the process. Assuming homogeneous preservation, even under pessimistic assumptions regarding the completeness of the fossil record, the probability of finding fossil ancestor-descendant pairs is not negligible. Even if all species of Phanerozoic marine invertebrates in the paleontologically important taxa had the same probability of preservation, on the order of 1\%-10\% or more of the known fossil species would be directly ancestral to other known fossil species. However, this is likely to be an underestimate, since the probability of finding ancestor-descendant pairs is enhanced by taxonomic, temporal, and spatial heterogeneities in preservation probability. Moreover, indirect genealogical relationships substantially increase the probability of finding ancestor-descendant pairs. The model of budding, the only one in which an ancestor can persist after a branching event, predicts that half or more of extant species have ancestors that are also extant. Thus, the question of how to recognize ancestor-descendant pairs must be carefully considered.},

	abstract = {The history of phylogenetic reconstruction in palaeoanthropology shows considerable variation in the number of taxa recognized. Recent and current interpretations allow a range from a minimum of five to a maximum of 17 taxa to be identified in the fossil record. Given this range it is appropriate to ask whether there are means by which the expected number of species can be calculated and compared with observations of the fossil record. Models of hominid diversity (numbers of species) are constructed using fossil mammalian longevity data, mammalian speciation rates and living primate and carnivore spatial patterns. These models are discussed in the context of the longevity of the hominid lineage, its geographical distribution, and its adaptive basis. The results suggest that there may be strong interactions between ecological processes and evolutionary patterns in hominid evolution, and that early and later phases may be characterized by contrasting patterns of evolution.},

	abstract = {The modern structure of marine benthic ecosystems was largely established during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (200-100 Ma), a transition that has been termed the Mesozoic Marine Revolution (MMR). Although it has been suggested that the MMR marks an increase in the average energy consumption of marine animal ecosystems, this hypothesis has not been evaluated quantitatively. In this study, we integrate body size and abundance data from the fossil record with physiological data from living representatives to estimate mean per capita metabolic rates of tropical to subtropical assemblages of shallow-marine gastropods—a major component of marine ecosystems throughout the Meso-Cenozoic—both before and after the MMR. We find that mean per capita metabolic rate rose by ∼150\% between the Late Triassic and Late Cretaceous and remained relatively stable thereafter. The most important factor governing the increase in metabolic rate was an increase in mean body size. In principle, this size increase could result from secular changes in sampling and taphonomic biases, but these biases are suggested to yield decreases rather than increases in mean size. Considering that post-MMR gastropod diversity is dominated by predators, the net primary production required to supply the energetic needs of the average individual increased by substantially more than 150\%. These data support the hypothesis that benthic energy budgets increased during the MMR, possibly in response to rising primary productivity.},

	abstract = {Major shifts in ecological dominance are one of the most conspicuous but poorly understood features of the fossil record. Here we examine one of the most prominent such shifts, the Ordovician shift from trilobite to brachiopod dominance of benthic ecosystems. Using an integrated database of high-resolution paleoecological samples and body size data, we show that while the average local richness and relative abundance of trilobites declined significantly through the Ordovician, the estimated standing biomass of trilobites, and by implication the amount of energy that they used, remained relatively invariant. This is attributable to an increase in the average body size of trilobite species in our data set, and especially to the widespread occurrence of the exceptionally large Middle–Late Ordovician trilobite genus Isotelus. Brachiopods increase in both mean body size and relative abundance throughout the Ordovician, so that estimates of brachiopod biomass and energetic use increase substantially between the Early and Late Ordovician. Although the data set includes a range of depositional environments, similar trends are observed in both shallow subtidal and deep subtidal settings. These results suggest that diversification of the Paleozoic Fauna did not come at the energetic expense of the Cambrian Fauna. The declining relative abundance of trilobites may reflect a combination of numerical dilution and the necessary energetic trade-offs between body size and abundance.},

The Siwaliks of the Potwar Plateau, northern Pakistan, present perhaps the best example of a sequence of well dated faunal horizons spanning most of the Neogene in a single terrestrial biogeographic province. Temporal control on fossil localities tied to multiple paleomagnetic sections is ca. 0.1 m.y., less given special conditions of short magnetozone duration or superpositional relationships. New correlations are presented for two long sections in the lower Siwaliks showing the power and the limitations of mag-netostratigraphic correlation within the Siwalik depositional setting. Correlation of Potwar fossil localities to those of an East African section, also dated paleomagnetically, are established with fossil localities from those two biogeographic provinces shown to be coeval on a scale of  yr. The composite biostratigraphy rendered by the thick, well exposed, well dated Potwar Siwaliks enables definition of sequential bio-chronologic units without gaps. Utility of the biochronology lies in correlating isolated deposits to the Potwar composite; for studies within the Potwar, locality relationships and the biostratigraphy itself are the operational units. The history of the Siwalik fauna shows turnover episodes, but they differ in intensity, diversity of groups affected, and coincidence of first and last occurrences, probably reflecting different causes. Studies on the evolution of lineages are rendered more powerful by magnetostratigraphy: temporal control tests patterns of speciation, yields confident estimates on true temporal ranges of fossil taxa, and shows that rodent species longevities exceeded 2 m.y. on average.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in trait-based approaches to community assembly, little attention has been given to seasonal variation in trait distribution patterns. Mobile animals can rapidly mediate influences of environmental factors and species interactions through dispersal, suggesting that the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms can vary over short time scales. This study analyzes seasonal changes in functional trait distributions of tropical fishes in the Xingu River, a major tributary of the Amazon with large predictable temporal variation in hydrologic conditions and species density. Comparison of observed functional diversity revealed that species within wet-season assemblages were more functionally similar than those in dry-season assemblages. Further, species within wet-season assemblages were more similar than random expectations based on null model predictions. Higher functional richness within dry season communities is consistent with increased niche complementarity during the period when fish densities are highest and biotic interactions should be stronger; however, null model tests suggest that stochastic factors or a combination of assembly mechanisms influence dry-season assemblages. These results demonstrate that the relative influence of community assembly mechanisms can vary seasonally in response to changing abiotic conditions, and suggest that studies attempting to infer a single dominant mechanism from functional patterns may overlook important aspects of the assembly process. During the prolonged flood pulse of the wet season, expanded habitat and lower densities of aquatic organisms likely reduce the influence of competition and predation. This temporal shift in the influence of different assembly mechanisms, rather than any single mechanism, may play a large role in maintaining the structure and diversity of tropical rivers and perhaps other dynamic and biodiverse systems.

	abstract = {Selectivity patterns provide insights into the causes of ancient extinction events. The Late Ordovician mass extinction was related to Gondwanan glaciation; however, it is still unclear whether elevated extinction rates were attributable to record failure, habitat loss, or climatic cooling. We examined Middle Ordovician-Early Silurian North American fossil occurrences within a spatiotemporally explicit stratigraphic framework that allowed us to quantify rock record effects on a per-taxon basis and assay the interplay of macrostratigraphic and macroecological variables in determining extinction risk. Genera that had large proportions of their observed geographic ranges affected by stratigraphic truncation or environmental shifts at the end of the Katian stage were particularly hard hit. The duration of the subsequent sampling gaps had little effect on extinction risk, suggesting that this extinction pulse cannot be entirely attributed to rock record failure; rather, it was caused, in part, by habitat loss. Extinction risk at this time was also strongly influenced by the maximum paleolatitude at which a genus had previously been sampled, a macroecological trait linked to thermal tolerance. A model trained on the relationship between 16 explanatory variables and extinction patterns during the early Katian interval substantially underestimates the extinction of exclusively tropical taxa during the late Katian interval. These results indicate that glacioeustatic sea-level fall and tropical ocean cooling played important roles in the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction in Laurentia.},

Specifically, the ETH suggests that regions, and spatial scales, that exhibit a larger rate of environmental distance decay (DD) should exhibit more rapid rates of species turnover. The ETH should apply over any range of scales where the environment is driving species distributions. To examine the relevance of the ETH at local spatial scales, we tested for a positive relationship between the rate of change in soil chemical properties and vascular plant species composition in grassland and woodland habitats. We recorded presence–absence data along a 1.883 km transect in each habitat and estimated the rate of turnover and environmental DD for spatial lags of 1–41 m. We found that the soil environment explained spatial patterns of species composition more accurately in the grassland habitat compared to the woodland habitat. Consequently the rate of change in soil properties as a function of spatial distance was significantly positively correlated with the rate of species turnover in the grassland but not the woodland. Our study suggests that one of the central premises of the ETH is relevant for local patterns of species turnover if the environment appears to influence species composition.},

Some tephra are distinguishable solely using phenocrysts, but some are too similar in mineral composition or too poor in phenocrysts to definitively “fingerprint” without glass. Titanomagnetite phenocrysts were mostly altered; characterization was thus limited to feldspar, augite, and hornblende compositions for most tephra. Phenocryst compositions were compared to Olduvai tephra compositions to see if any regional tephra could be identified that could help correlate the sites. Augite or hornblende composition rules out potential correlations of Olduvai Bed I Tuff IF and the Bed II Bird Print Tuff or Tuff IID to otherwise similar Peninj Group tephra. Despite their overlap in age and locations at less than {\textasciitilde}80km from the Ngorongoro Volcanic Highlands, Peninj and Olduvai have different tephra records, which limits the possibilities for establishing a regional tephrostratigraphic framework.},

Little consensus has emerged regarding how proximate and ultimate drivers such as abundance, productivity, disturbance, and temperature may affect species richness and other aspects of biodiversity. Part of the confusion is that most studies examine species richness at a single spatial scale and ignore how the underlying components of species richness can vary with spatial scale.
2.	We provide an approach for the measurement of biodiversity (MoB) that decomposes scale-specific changes in richness into proximate components attributed to: 1) the species abundance distribution, 2) density of individuals, and 3) the spatial arrangement of individuals. We decompose species richness using a nested comparison of individual- and plot-based species rarefaction and accumulation curves. 
3.	Each curve provides some unique scale-specific information on the underlying components of species richness. We tested the validity of our method on simulated data, and we demonstrate it on empirical data on plant species richness in invaded and uninvaded woodlands. We integrated these methods into a new R package (mobr).  
4.	The metrics that mobr provides will allow ecologists to move beyond comparisons of species richness at a single spatial scale towards a more mechanistic understanding of the drivers of community organization that incorporates information on the scale dependence of the proximate components of species richness.},

	doi = {10.1017/S1464793101005887},
	abstract = {Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the shape of occupancy frequency distributions (distributions of the numbers of species occupying different numbers of areas). Artefactual effects include sampling characteristics, whereas biological mechanisms include organismal, niche-based and metapopulation models. To date, there has been little testing of these models. In addition, although empirically derived occupancy distributions encompass an array of taxa and spatial scales, comparisons between them are often not possible because of differences in sampling protocol and method of construction. In this paper, the effects of sampling protocol (grain, sample number, extent, sampling coverage and intensity) on the shape of occupancy distributions are examined, and approaches for minimising artefactual effects recommended. Evidence for proposed biological determinants of the shape of occupancy distributions is then examined. Good support exists for some mechanisms (habitat and environmental heterogeneity), little for others (dispersal ability), while some hypotheses remain untested (landscape productivity, position in geographic range, range size frequency distributions), or are unlikely to be useful explanations for the shape of occupancy distributions (species specificity and adaptation to habitat, extinction–colonization dynamics). The presence of a core (class containing species with the highest occupancy) mode in occupancy distributions is most likely to be associated with larger sample units, and small homogenous sampling areas positioned well within and towards the range centers of a sufficient proportion of the species in the assemblage. Satellite (class with species with the lowest occupancy) modes are associated with sampling large, heterogeneous areas that incorporate a large proportion of the assemblage range. However, satellite modes commonly also occur in the presence of a core mode, and rare species effects are likely to contribute to the presence of a satellite mode at most sampling scales. In most proposed hypotheses, spatial scale is an important determinant of the shape of the observed occupancy distribution. Because the attributes of the mechanisms associated with these hypotheses change with spatial scale, their predictions for the shape of occupancy distributions also change. To understand occupancy distributions and the mechanisms underlying them, a synthesis of pattern documentation and model testing across scales is thus needed. The development of null models, comparisons of occupancy distributions across spatial scales and taxa, documentation of the movement of individual species between occupancy classes with changes in spatial scale, as well as further testing of biological mechanisms are all necessary for an improved understanding of the distribution of species and assemblages within their geographic ranges.},

The Omo Group constitutes up to 800 m of subaerially exposed sediments surrounding Lake Turkana within the East African Rift system in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. Rhyolitic explosive eruptions produced tuffs and pumice clasts that are considered to have been deposited shortly after eruption. The new age data on feldspars from the pumice clasts range from 4.02 ± 0.04 Ma for the Naibar Tuff of the Koobi Fora Formation to 1.53 ± 0.02 Ma for Tuff K of the Shungura Formation. The Orange Tuff in the KBS Member of the Koobi Fora Formation was dated at 1.76 ± 0.03 Ma, providing good control in this part of the sequence where formerly there was a {\textgreater}200 ka gap. Data are consistent with earlier measurements and significantly improve age resolution within the Omo Group, which has yielded many vertebrate fossils, including hominin fossils comprising a number of species. We suggest new age estimates for a limited number of hominin specimens.

However, the provenance and age of the fossils have been much debated. Here we confirm that the Omo I and Omo II hominid fossils are from similar stratigraphic levels in Member I of the Kibish Formation, despite the view that Omo I is more modern in appearance than Omo II. 40Ar/39Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older limit of 198 14 kyr (weighted mean age 196 2 kyr) on the hominids. A younger age limit of 104 7 kyr is provided by feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reflect increased flow of the Nile River, and necessarily increased flow of the Omo River. Thus the 40Ar/39Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish hominids is 195 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated anatomically modern humans yet described.},

	abstract = {1 Nestedness is a composite property of many suites of biotas. Such patterns may be driven by dispersal limitation, species–area relationships, hierarchical niche requirements, or occur as an artefact of passive sampling. Despite its widespread occurrence, few studies have explored the factors underlying nested subset structure, and ecological distinctions between nested and non-nested (idiosyncratic) taxa within a region have been largely ignored. 2 Macroinvertebrate assemblages from 45 heathland ponds in south-west England are used to (i) unravel the relative importance of processes driving nested subset structure and (ii) test spatially explicit hypotheses concerning the response of nested and idiosyncratic taxa to parameters shown to structure assemblage-level nestedness. 3 Despite being dominated by taxa with good powers of inter-site dispersal, pond macroinvertebrate assemblages were found to be significantly nested. This nesting was not due to passive sampling, and was best explained by pond area, with habitat parameters and isolation being of secondary importance. 4 The spatial responses of nested and idiosyncratic taxa matched predictions; nested taxa showed strong spatial structure, which was reduced when the effects of pond area and habitat were removed. In contrast, a greater proportion of idiosyncratic taxa were completely spatially random and exhibited weaker responses to factors that structure assemblage level nestedness. 5 Nested and idiosyncratic species tend to differ ecologically: idiosyncratic taxa generally possess broad ecological tolerance and good dispersal capacity, whilst nested species are more likely to have narrow tolerances or limited powers of dispersal. 6 Factors structuring nestedness in ponds can be viewed as probabilistic filters which act to limit the spatial distribution of species with narrow ecological tolerance or low dispersal tendency. Nestedness analysis alone fails to elucidate processes that structure assemblage composition. The additional use of spatially explicit analyses is important if processes that generate nested pattern across a region are to be understood.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe northern Kenya Rift is bounded on the west by uplands of Turkana which comprise horst-like blocks that include metamorphic basement rocks, locally overlain unconformably by the Cretaceous Lubur Sandstone, in turn overlain by predominantly volcanic sequences in which relatively thin sedimentary packages occur. Amphibolite facies crystalline rocks of the basement yield Early Palaeozoic K–Ar cooling ages reflecting the Pan-African Orogeny. Volcanism in Turkana was initiated through voluminous eruptions of transitional tholeiitic basalts commencing about 36 Ma ago in the Late Eocene, with some evidence for concomitant rhyolitic volcanism. Volcanism became dominantly rhyolitic in the interval from about 27 to 23 Ma ago, but remained bimodal as basaltic lavas are also known from this period. From about 19 to 15 Ma or younger, basaltic volcanism again dominated, often alkaline in nature, with thin but significant sedimentary sequences interleaved that have yielded important vertebrate faunal assemblages. Parallels exist between the volcanic history recorded in Turkana and that found in the Nabwal Hills east of Lake Turkana. In the southern Turkana region, oil exploration by seismic methods and deep drill holes has shown the existence of northerly-trending half-graben with up to 7 km of fill, and that these developed from at least Oligocene and possibly Late Eocene times. This suggests that the widespread basaltic volcanism at about 36 Ma ago (Late Eocene) heralds an earlier initiation of the Kenya Rift in northern Kenya than most workers have previously suggested.},

Yet, whether animal communities respond consistently to changes in woody vegetation in savannas, particularly in terms of the effects of spatial scale, remains poorly understood. We addressed this gap by testing for changes in birds, bats and terrestrial small mammals across a gradient of woody cover in the savannas of southeastern Africa for two years at multiple spatial scales. We found that homogenization of vegetation structure corresponded with decreases in animal richness, diversity and functional diversity. Additionally, metrics of animal diversity declined at opposing ends of a canopy cover gradient ({\textless}10\% and {\textgreater}65\%), where we found distinctly different animal assemblages. These patterns were consistently more pronounced on a broader grid scale (30.25 ha) when compared with the plot scale (0.25 ha). The broad-scale reductions in the diversity and functions of animals observed may be indicative of reductions in the resilience, stability and ecosystem function of tropical savannas. Our results suggest that conservation and management aimed at promoting heterogeneity at broad scales may be critical for maintaining diversity and functionality in savannas.},

Competing models suggest biodiversity is either resource-limited or far from any bound. We test the hypothesis that functional diversity in marine bivalve communities is constrained by energy availability, measured as particulate organic carbon (POC) flux, in the modern oceans. We find that POC flux predicts the relative prevalence of ecological modes in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Moreover, the associations of ecological modes with POC fluxes are similar between the Atlantic and Pacific despite being based on independent sets of species, indicating a direct causal relationship. We then use the relationship between POC flux and the prevalence of functional groups in the modern to test the hypothesis that the trend of increasing functional diversity in bivalves across the past 500 Myr has occurred in response to increased POC flux. We find no evidence that the earliest-appearing modes of life are preferentially associated with low-POC environments or that the mean POC flux experienced by marine bivalves has increased across geological time. To reconcile the close association between ecological mode and POC flux in the modern oceans with the lack of evidence for increasing POC fluxes across time, we propose that POC flux has not increased substantially over time but, rather, the increase in bivalve functional diversity enabled bivalves to become more abundant, to occupy a broader range of environments, and to capture a greater fraction of the total POC flux. The results here suggest at the geographic scale of oceans and through geologic time bivalve diversity was not bounded by food availability.},

	abstract = {Proponents of the model known as the “human revolution” claim that modern human behaviors arose suddenly, and nearly simultaneously, throughout the Old World ca. 40–50 ka. This fundamental behavioral shift is purported to signal a cognitive advance, a possible reorganization of the brain, and the origin of language. Because the earliest modern human fossils, Homo sapiens sensu stricto, are found in Africa and the adjacent region of the Levant at \&gt;100 ka, the “human revolution” model creates a time lag between the appearance of anatomical modernity and perceived behavioral modernity, and creates the impression that the earliest modern Africans were behaviorally primitive. This view of events stems from a profound Eurocentric bias and a failure to appreciate the depth and breadth of the African archaeological record. In fact, many of the components of the “human revolution” claimed to appear at 40–50 ka are found in the African Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the “human revolution” model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World. The African Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominid fossil record is fairly continuous and in it can be recognized a number of probably distinct species that provide plausible ancestors for H. sapiens. The appearance of Middle Stone Age technology and the first signs of modern behavior coincide with the appearance of fossils that have been attributed to H. helmei, suggesting the behavior of H. helmei is distinct from that of earlier hominid species and quite similar to that of modern people. If on anatomical and behavioral grounds H. helmei is sunk into H. sapiens, the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250–300 ka.},

	abstract = {The role of climate change in the origin and diversification of early hominins is hotly debated. Most accounts of early hominin evolution link observed fluctuations in species diversity to directional shifts in climate or periods of intense climatic instability. None of these hypotheses, however, have tested whether observed diversity patterns are distorted by variation in the quality of the hominin fossil record. Here, we present a detailed examination of early hominin diversity dynamics, including both taxic and phylogenetically corrected diversity estimates. Unlike past studies, we compare these estimates to sampling metrics for rock availability (hominin-, primate-, and mammal-bearing formations) and collection effort, to assess the geological and anthropogenic controls on the sampling of the early hominin fossil record. Taxic diversity, primate-bearing formations, and collection effort show strong positive correlations, demonstrating that observed patterns of early hominin taxic diversity can be explained by temporal heterogeneity in fossil sampling rather than genuine evolutionary processes. Peak taxic diversity at 1.9 million years ago (Ma) is a sampling artifact, reflecting merely maximal rock availability and collection effort. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity estimates imply peak diversity at 2.4 Ma and show little relation to sampling metrics. We find that apparent relationships between early hominin diversity and indicators of climatic instability are, in fact, driven largely by variation in suitable rock exposure and collection effort. Our results suggest that significant improvements in the quality of the fossil record are required before the role of climate in hominin evolution can be reliably determined.},

	abstract = {The response of species diversity to dispersal capability is inherently scale-dependent: increasing dispersal capability is expected to increase diversity at the local scale, while decreasing diversity at the metacommunity scale. However, these expectations are based on model formulations that neglect dispersal limitation and species segregation at the local scale. We developed a unifying framework of dispersal–diversity relationships and tested the generality of these expectations. For this purpose we used a spatially-explicit neutral model with various combinations of survey area (local scale) and landscape size (metacommunity scale). Simulations were conducted using landscapes of finite and of conceptually infinite size. We analyzed the scale-dependence of dispersal-diversity relationships for exponentially-bounded versus fat-tailed dispersal kernels, several levels of speciation rate and contrasting assumptions on recruitment at short dispersal distances. We found that the ratio of survey area to landscape size is a major determinant of dispersal–diversity relationships. With increasing survey-to-landscape area ratio the dispersal–diversity relationship switches from monotonically increasing through a U-shaped pattern (with a local minimum) to a monotonically decreasing pattern. Therefore, we provide a continuous set of dispersal–diversity relationships, which contains the response shapes reported previously as extreme cases. We suggest the mean dispersal distance with the minimum of species diversity (minimizing dispersal distance) for a certain scenario as a key characteristic of dispersal–diversity relationships. We show that not only increasing mean dispersal distances, but also increasing variances of dispersal can enhance diversity at the local scale, given a diverse species pool at the metacommunity scale. In conclusion, the response of diversity to variations of dispersal capability at spatial scales of interest, e.g. conservation areas, can differ more widely than expected previously. Therefore, land use and conservation activities, which manipulate dispersal capability, need to consider the landscape context and potential species pools carefully.},

	abstract = {Abstract Estimating biodiversity and its change in space and time poses serious methodological challenges. First, there has been a long debate on how to quantify biodiversity, and second, measurements of biodiversity and its change are scale?dependent. Therefore, comparisons of biodiversity metrics between communities are ideally carried out across scales. Simulations can be used to study the behaviour of biodiversity metrics across scales, but most approaches are system specific, plagued by large parameter spaces, and therefore cumbersome to use and interpret. However, realistic spatial biodiversity patterns can be generated without reference to ecological processes, which suggests a simple simulation framework as important tool for ecologists. Here, we present the r package mobsim that allows users to simulate the abundances and the distributions of individuals of different species in a spatially explicit landscape. Users can define key properties of communities, including the total number of individuals, the species?abundance distribution (SAD) and the degree of intraspecific spatial aggregation. Furthermore, the package provides functions that derive biodiversity measures, such as rarefaction curves and species?area relationships (SAR), from simulated communities or from observed data, as well as functions that simulate different sampling designs. We show several example applications of the package. First, we illustrate how species rarefaction and accumulation curves can be used to disentangle changes in the fundamental components that underlie biodiversity: (i) total abundance, (ii) species?abundance distribution and (iii) species aggregation. Second, we demonstrate how mobsim can be applied to assess the performance of species?richness estimators. The latter indicates how spatial aggregation challenges classical non?spatial species?richness estimators. mobsim allows the simulation and analysis of a large range of biodiversity scenarios and sampling designs in a comprehensive way by directly manipulating key community properties. The simplicity and control provided by the package also makes it a useful didactic tool. The combination of controlled simulations and their analysis will facilitate a more rigorous interpretation of real?world data that exhibit sampling effects and scale dependence.},

Despite this importance, generalizable approaches for predicting competitive outcomes across abiotic gradients are lacking, driven largely by the highly complex and context-dependent nature of biotic interactions. Here, we present and empirically test a novel niche model that uses functional traits to model the niche space of organisms and predict competitive outcomes of co-occurring populations across multiple resource gradients. The model makes no assumptions about the underlying mode of competition and instead applies to those settings where relative competitive ability across environments correlates with a quantifiable performance metric. To test the model, a series of controlled microcosm experiments were conducted using genetically related strains of a widespread microbe. The model identified trait microevolution and performance differences among strains, with the predicted competitive ability of each organism mapped across a two-dimensional carbon and nitrogen resource space. Areas of coexistence and competitive dominance between strains were identified, and the predicted competitive outcomes were validated in approximately 95\% of the pairings. By linking trait variation to competitive ability, our work demonstrates a generalizable approach for predicting and modelling competitive outcomes across changing environmental contexts.},

Patterns in population processes have been described at numerous scales. We show that two patterns, measured at different scales, jointly allow us to infer heretofore unknown patterns in the distribution of demographic patterns across the geographical range of a species. The resulting model describes three fundamentally different modes of geographical variation in vital rates of populations. One mode is characterized by a positive nonlinear relationship between the maximum rate of population growth and the intensity of intraspecific competition across a geographical range. That is, populations that grow rapidly are also those where individuals experience the greatest per capita negative effect of the presence of other individuals. The second mode of behaviour is described by a negative nonlinear relationship between maximum growth rate and density dependence. Under this scenario, populations with low capacity to grow rapidly have highest intensities of intraspecific competitive effects. A third mode of behaviour is characterized by a weak positive relationship between growth rate and intraspecific competition, with very little geographical variation in maximum growth rate. A survey of studies relating temporal means and variances in population abundance for a variety of species indicate that the second mode of geographical variation in population dynamics across species ranges is the most common, though a few species appear to be characterized by the third mode.},

Abstract
Though many processes are involved in determining which species coexist and assemble into communities, competition is among the best studied. One hypothesis about competition’s contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

The effects of energy use are represented by parameters that characterize the average effects of energy use by each species in the biota on speciation and extinction rates. The dynamics of the model describe a sigmoidal increase in species number over time, as does the logistic model of species dynamics. However, the mechanisms of those dynamics are assumed to be different in the two models.

	abstract = {Current evidence suggests that all of the major events in hominin evolution have occurred in East Africa. Over the last two decades, there has been intensive work undertaken to understand African palaeoclimate and tectonics in order to put together a coherent picture of how the environment of East Africa has varied in the past. The landscape of East Africa has altered dramatically over the last 10 million years. It has changed from a relatively flat, homogenous region covered with mixed tropical forest, to a varied and heterogeneous environment, with mountains over 4 km high and vegetation ranging from desert to cloud forest. The progressive rifting of East Africa has also generated numerous lake basins, which are highly sensitive to changes in the local precipitation-evaporation regime. There is now evidence that the presence of precession-driven, ephemeral deep-water lakes in East Africa were concurrent with major events in hominin evolution. It seems the unusual geology and climate of East Africa created periods of highly variable local climate, which, it has been suggested could have driven hominin speciation, encephalisation and dispersal out of Africa. One example is the significant hominin speciation and brain expansion event at ∼1.8 Ma that seems to have been coeval with the occurrence of highly variable, extensive, deep-water lakes. This complex, climatically very variable setting inspired first the variability selection hypothesis, which was then the basis for the pulsed climate variability hypothesis. The newer of the two suggests that the long-term drying trend in East Africa was punctuated by episodes of short, alternating periods of extreme humidity and aridity. Both hypotheses, together with other key theories of climate-evolution linkages, are discussed in this paper. Though useful the actual evolution mechanisms, which led to early hominins are still unclear and continue to be debated. However, it is clear that an understanding of East African lakes and their palaeoclimate history is required to understand the context within which humans evolved and eventually left East Africa.},

In Africa, however, the need for scheduled consumption shaped the development of food production. African cattle were domesticated during the tenth millennium BP by delayed-return Saharan hunter-gatherers in unstable, marginal environments where predictable access to resources was a more significant problem than absolute abundance. Pastoralism spread patchily across the continent according to regional variations in the relative predictability of herding versus hunting and gathering. Domestication of African plants was late (after 4000 BP) because of the high mobility of herders, and risk associated with cultivation in arid environments. Renewed attention to predictability may contribute to understanding the circumstances that led to domestication in other regions of the world.},

An equivalent number of families experienced a comparable rise and decline in North America during the same interval.

The greater number of North American genera (24) initially entering South America than the reverse (12) is predicted by the proportions of reservoir genera on the two continents.

The method requires a quantitative measure of collecting and/or preservation biases with stratigraphic position. This fossil recovery potential function may be based on (among other variables) bedding-plane surface areas, or, given a water depth curve, an a priori estimate of the preservation potential with water depth. The approach assumes that the observed distribution of fossil horizons is consistent with the distribution predicted by the fossil recovery potential function, an assumption that must be tested before the method is applied. Unlike previous methods for calculating confidence intervals on the end points of stratigraphic ranges, this method may be applied when the number of fossil horizons is correlated with stratigraphic position. The approach should only be applied to sections that have been sampled continuously, or approximately continuously. Its efficacy will depend on how accurately fossil recovery potentials can be determined. A method is also presented for estimating the probability that a species became extinct during a major hiatus in the rock record.},

Strauss and Sadler (1987, 1989) provide a method for calculating confidence intervals on the endpoints of local stratigraphic ranges. Their method can also be applied to composite sections; confidence intervals may be placed on times of origin and extinction for entire species or lineages. Confidence interval sizes depend only on the length of the stratigraphic range and the number of fossil horizons. The technique's most important assumptions are that fossil horizons are distributed randomly and that collecting intensity has been uniform over the stratigraphic range. These assumptions are more difficult to test and less likely to be fulfilled for composite sections than for local sections.Confidence intervals give useful baseline estimates of the incompleteness of the fossil record, even if the underlying assumptions cannot be tested. Confidence intervals, which can be very large, should be calculated when the fossil record is used to assess absolute rates of molecular or morphological evolution, especially for poorly preserved groups. Confidence intervals have other functions: to determine how rich the fossil record has to be before radiometric dating errors become the dominant source of error in estimated times of origin or extinction; to predict future fossil finds; to predict which species with fossil records should be extant; and to assess phylogenetic hypotheses and taxonomic assignments.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently there have been major theoretical advances in the quantification and partitioning of diversity within and among communities, regions, and ecosystems. However, applying those advances to real data remains a challenge. Ecologists often end up describing their samples rather than estimating the diversity components of an underlying study system, and existing approaches do not easily provide statistical frameworks for testing ecological questions. Here we offer one avenue to do all of the above using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We estimate posterior distributions of the underlying ?true? relative abundances of each species within each unit sampled. These posterior estimates of relative abundance can then be used with existing formulae to estimate and partition diversity. The result is a posterior distribution of diversity metrics describing our knowledge (or beliefs) about the study system. This approach intuitively leads to statistical inferences addressing biologically motivated hypotheses via Bayesian model comparison. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our approach does as well or better at approximating the ?true? diversity of a community relative to naïve or ad?hoc bias?corrected estimates. Moreover, model comparison correctly distinguishes between alternative hypotheses about the distribution of diversity within and among samples. Finally, we use an empirical ecological dataset to illustrate how the approach can be used to address questions about the makeup and diversities of assemblages at local and regional scales.},

Herein, a method is presented for calculating confidence intervals on the end-points of stratigraphic ranges that partially relaxes this assumption: the method will work for any continuous distribution of gap sizes, not just those generated by random processes. The price paid for the generality of the new approach is twofold: (1) there are uncertainties associated with the sizes of the confidence intervals, and (2) for large confidence values (e.g., 95\%) a rich fossil record is required to place upper bounds on the corresponding confidence intervals. This new method is not universal; like the method for calculating classical confidence intervals it is based on the assumption that there is no correlation between gap size and stratigraphic position. The fossil record of the Neogene Caribbean bryozoan Metrarabdotos is analyzed with the new approach. The equations developed here, like those for classical confidence intervals, should not be applied to stratigraphic ranges based on discrete sampling regimes, such as those typically established from deep-sea drilling cores, though there are exceptions to this rule.},

Previous studies on North American mammals suggest that body size distributions are highly modal and right skewed at continental scales, but become more uniform as spatial scale decreases. We show, in general, that these patterns also hold for the body size distribution of South American terrestrial mammals. However, we also found some striking differences attributable to the history of this biota and related to the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI). At continental scales the distribution of body masses for South American mammals is highly right skewed and possesses several modes. One mode corresponds to species derived from North American ancestors, while a second mode, towards larger size, is characteristic of the South American stock. The same pattern is apparent at biome and local habitat scales. We found support for the progressive flattening of the distributions as spatial scale decreases, but they do not become as flat (indistinguishable from log-uniform) as they do in North America. However, the pattern is stronger for species of South American origin. Our results indicate that there is a strong historical component affecting the macroecological structure of contemporary assemblages at different spatial scales. Body size distributions can provide valuable information on the ways biotas built up.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure, yet the nature of contemporary biodiversity change is not well understood. Growing evidence that community size is regulated highlights the need for improved understanding of community dynamics. As stability in community size could be underpinned by marked temporal turnover, a key question is the extent to which changes in both biodiversity dimensions (temporal α- and temporal β-diversity) covary within and among the assemblages that comprise natural communities. Here, we draw on a multiassemblage dataset (encompassing vertebrates, invertebrates, and unicellular plants) from a tropical freshwater ecosystem and employ a cyclic shift randomization to assess whether any directional change in temporal α-diversity and temporal β-diversity exceeds baseline levels. In the majority of cases, α-diversity remains stable over the 5-y time frame of our analysis, with little evidence for systematic change at the community level. In contrast, temporal β-diversity changes are more prevalent, and the two diversity dimensions are decoupled at both the within- and among-assemblage level. Consequently, a pressing research challenge is to establish how turnover supports regulation and when elevated temporal β-diversity jeopardizes community integrity.},

Sampling resolution was very good, between 5 × 103 and 15 × 103 yr across the Miocene/Pliocene boundary and about 2 × 105 yr otherwise. The test shape was analyzed in edge view, permitting determinations of variation in inflation and elongation of the test. Shape was analyzed quantitatively using eigenshape analysis. This method represents the greatest proportion of variation observed among a collection of shapes by the least number of different shapes. The Late Miocene (10.4-5.6 Myr B.P.) populations exhibited only minor fluctuations in shape that did not result in any net phyletic change. This period of stasis was followed by an 0.6-Myr-long period (between 5.6 and 5.0 Myr B.P.) of gradual transformation of the Late Miocene morphotype (G. plesiotumida) into the Early Pliocene morphotype (G. tumida). The populations were again more or less in stasis in the Pliocene and Pleistocene (5.0 Myr to the present day), so that no major modifications of the newly evolved Early Pliocene morphotype occurred during these 5 Myr. Thus it would appear that the G. tumida lineage, while remaining in relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching. This pattern does not conform to the gradualistic model of evolution, because that would assume gradual changes throughout the history of the lineage. It also does not conform to the punctuational model, because (1) there was no speciation (lineage branching) in this lineage and (2) the transition was not rapid enough ({\textless}1\% of the descendant species' duration according to definition). For this evolutionary modality we propose the term “punctuated gradualism” and suggest that this may be a common norm for evolution—at least within the planktonic foraminifera.},

	abstract = {To withstand the pressures of a rapidly changing world, resilient ecosystems should exhibit compensatory dynamics, including uncorrelated temporal shifts in population sizes. The observation that diversity is maintained through time in many systems is evidence that communities are indeed regulated and stabilized, yet empirical observations suggest that positive covariance in species abundances is widespread. This paradox could be resolved if communities are composed of a number of ecologically relevant sub-units in which the members compete for resources, but whose abundances fluctuate independently. Such modular organization could explain community regulation, even when the community as a whole appears synchronized. To test this hypothesis, we quantified temporal synchronicity in annual population abundances within spatial guilds in an estuarine fish assemblage that has been monitored for 36 years. We detected independent fluctuations in annual abundances within guilds. By contrast, the assemblage as a whole exhibited temporal synchronicity—an outcome linked to the dynamics of guild dominants, which were synchronized with each other. These findings underline the importance of modularity in explaining community regulation and highlight the need to protect assemblage composition and structure as well as species richness.},

	abstract = {The depositional history of Upper Miocene through Recent sediments from DSDP Site 214 (Ninetyeast Ridge, Indian Ocean) is reexamined. Samples of the Globorotalia tumida planktic foraminiferal lineage, originally obtained from these sediments by Malmgren et al. (1983), serve as the empirical basis for the recognition of punctuated anagenesis as a distinct mode of phenotypic evolution and have been the subject of numerous additional investigations. However, conclusions reached by previous authors depend strictly on the validity of the original chronostratigraphic interpretation of these sediments. Graphic correlation analysis of first- and last-appearance datum levels for a total of 41 planktic foraminiferal, radiolarian, and calcareous nannoplankton taxa provides evidence for a more complex depositional history at this deep-sea site than originally believed. Based on a conservative model of variation in the pattern of sediment accumulation rates, the lowermost portion of the studied section (6.5-4.3 Ma) represents an interval of temporally condensed sediment accumulation (1.88 cm/1,000 yr) followed by an interval (4.3-2.8 Ma) of temporally expanded sediment accumulation (3.97 cm/1,000 yr). This interval, in turn, is followed by a depositional hiatus or an extremely condensed interval, at least 800,000 yr in duration, which is followed by another relatively condensed (1.36 cm/1,000 yr) interval from 2.0 Ma-Recent. Although this chronostratigraphic reinterpretation deviates substantially from the original, which recognized Site 214 as being both temporally continuous and exhibiting a constant sediment accumulation rate from the Upper Miocene through the Upper Pliocene, it is more consistent with expectations based on Neogene eustatic sea-level fluctuations and global surveys of Neogene hiatus distributions. Age assignments for samples of the Gr. tumida lineage based on the revised chronostratigraphic model reverse some findings of previous investigators with respect to the distinctiveness of phenotypic evolutionary rates characterizing the transition from Gr. plesiotumida to Gr. tumida. Finally, a brief survey of similar marine invertebrate lineage studies shows that changes in the rate of phenotypic evolution often appear to coincide with major physical changes in the paleoceanographic environment. Such correspondences may be due, at least in part, to the effect of these environmental changes on sediment accumulation rates. Paleobiologists who seek to understand patterns of phenotypic change over time must remove the effects of variations in sediment accumulation rates from their data before evolutionary hypothesis testing and remain aware of the limitations imposed on their interpretations by the uncertain nature of chronostratigraphic inference.},

Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Minnesota, USA.},

	abstract = {1. Species diversity is most simply measured by counting species. More complicated measures, which take into account the relative abundance of the species, have been derived from information theory or from parameters of statistical distributions fitted to the census data. The information theory formulae can also be used to measure habitat diversity and differences between communities or habitats. In this way, changes in the pattern of species diversity can be compared with changes in the environment. 2. Small or remote islands and islands with uniform topography have fewer species than large or complex islands or islands nearer the source of colonization. For birds and some orders of insects it appears that the rate of colonization of new species is virtually balanced by the rate of extinction, so that the number of species has reached equilibrium. For other organisms, such as mammals, and for all organisms on the most remote islands, this equilibrium has probably not been reached and further increases in the fauna may be expected. The comparison of impoverished island faunas with the mainland faunas whence they were derived shows the effect of relaxed competition. 3. Local variations in the species diversity of small uniform habitats can usually be predicted in terms of the structure and productivity of the habitat. Habitats of similar structure on islands and mainland often have similar species diversities; the impoverishment of the island is reflected in the fact that different habitats on the island have nearly the same species, while different habitats on the mainland have more different species. This is interpreted as evidence that uniform habitats are nearly saturated with species and that new species usually colonize by occupying different habitats from present species. 4. The theory of competition and the facts of character displacement indicate that there is a limiting similarity to species which co-exist within a habitat. Species more similar than this limiting value must occupy different habitats. According to the theory, this limiting value should be less where productivity is high, where family size is low and where the seasons are relatively uniform. It should also be less for pursuing hunters than for species which search for stationary prey. 5. Total species diversities, from areas composed of many types of habitat, are usually, but not always, much greater in the tropics than in temperate regions. This is accomplished by a finer subdivision of habitats (habitat selection) more than by a marked increase in diversity within habitats. This total diversity may still be increasing and may have not reached saturation.},

The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data. The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's Song of the Dodo to arguments in the professional literature, The Theory of Island Biogeography remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species.

For bird populations, at least, discrepancies between observations and predictions are negligible except when the censused area is compounded from different habitats.

We demonstrate that niche limitation does not inevitably lead to low variance in species richness. Furthermore, low variance in species richness can be caused by physical limits to the number of individuals in a sample, and by spatial dependence. Two methods (the rotation/reflection method and the random shifts method) for creating spatially-explicit null models are proposed to correct for spatial dependence in transect-based and grid-based sampling schemes. These methods can also be used to correct for measures of association between species. The rotation/reflection method is not as powerful as the random shifts method, but the latter requires some simplifying assumptions about the nature of spatial patterns. A new sampling design, the trainsect, is proposed to eliminate the need for spatial assumptions.},

Traditionally, the SAT is described using the algebra method, without considering taxonomic characteristic differences between species. Here, we use the branch of mathematics known as set theory to reformulate the SAT, including the species-area relationship, endemic-area relationship, overlap-area relationship, and alpha, beta, and gamma diversity. Then fundamental equations are derived by this method: (1) the number of species in one area can be divided into two parts: species (endemic species) in only this area, and species (overlapping species) in both the focal and neighboring area. The total number of species in these two areas is equal to the sum of the number of species in one of the two areas and the number of species existing only in the other area. (2) A new definition of beta diversity is proposed to describe the overlapping species distribution among the local alpha diversity in the whole gamma diversity. Therefore, gamma diversity is the union of all alpha diversity or the union of all beta diversity.},

Two fundamental equations are derived from the relationship between the area and species number in a limited whole area A: 1) the sum of species number in area a and species number, here defined as endemics, in area A − a is the total species number in area A; 2) the number of species common to both areas a and A − a (overlapping species) equals the species number in area a minus the endemics number in area a.

	abstract = {1 Size relationships are central in structuring trophic linkages within food webs, leading to suggestions that the dietary niche of smaller carnivores is nested within that of larger species. However, past analyses have not taken into account the differing selection shown by carnivores for specific size ranges of prey, nor the extent to which the greater carcass mass of larger prey outweighs the greater numerical representation of smaller prey species in the predator diet. Furthermore, the top-down impact that predation has on prey abundance cannot be assessed simply in terms of the number of predator species involved. 2 Records of found carcasses and cause of death assembled over 46 years in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, corrected for under-recording of smaller species, enabled a definitive assessment of size relationships between large mammalian carnivores and their ungulate prey. Five carnivore species were considered, including lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and 22 herbivore prey species larger than 10 kg in adult body mass. 3 These carnivores selectively favoured prey species approximately half to twice their mass, within a total prey size range from an order of magnitude below to an order of magnitude above the body mass of the predator. The three smallest carnivores, i.e. leopard, cheetah and wild dog, showed high similarity in prey species favoured. Despite overlap in prey size range, each carnivore showed a distinct dietary preference. 4 Almost all mortality was through the agency of a predator for ungulate species up to the size of a giraffe (800–1200 kg). Ungulates larger than twice the mass of the predator contributed substantially to the dietary intake of lions, despite the low proportional mortality inflicted by predation on these species. Only for megaherbivores substantially exceeding 1000 kg in adult body mass did predation become a negligible cause of mortality. 5 Hence, the relative size of predators and prey had a pervasive structuring influence on biomass fluxes within this large-mammal food web. Nevertheless, the large carnivore assemblage was dominated overwhelmingly by the largest predator, which contributed the major share of animals killed across a wide size range.},

In Carabus japonicus beetles, of which the larvae exclusively prey on earthworms, adult body size is related to the presence/absence of a larger congener and habitat temperature. In sympatry, C. japonicus consistently exhibits smaller body size which is effective for avoiding interspecific mating, but in allopatry, it shows size variation unrelated to temperature. Here, we show that this predator–size variation is attributed to prey–size variation, associated with high phylogenetic diversity in earthworm communities. In allopatry, the predator size was larger where larger prey occurred. Larger adult size may have been selected because larger females produce larger larvae, which can subdue larger prey. Thus, in the absence of a larger congener, variation in prey body size had a pronounced effect on geographic body size divergence in C. japonicus.},

	abstract = {The richness (number of species) and evenness (uniformity of species abundances) of death assemblages can differ from corresponding living communities due to processes such as between-habitat transport, environmental condensation, and differential taphonomic destruction. Analysis of 132 single-census live-dead comparisons of benthic molluscs from a variety of soft-bottom marine settings indicates that on average evenness does not differ greatly between live and dead assemblages, regardless of the particular depositional setting or grain size of associated sediment. However, individual death assemblages can deviate quite substantially from their corresponding living assemblages, especially if processed using a fine mesh. In addition, death assemblages collected using sieves with 2 mm mesh or coarser showed consistently and significantly greater evenness than corresponding living assemblages. These results are encouraging for broad-scale assessments of evenness in the fossil record based on the comparison of average values (rather than for individual assemblages) and where trends in evenness are the aim of the study. Our live-dead comparisons of richness sample-size corrected by rarefaction revealed that death assemblages were on average ∼1.45 times richer than the corresponding living assemblages regardless of rarefied size. In 63.6\% of death assemblages both dead richness and dead evenness were greater than live, suggesting sufficient time-averaging to catch significant random or directional changes in the living community and/or introduction of individuals from outside the sampled habitat. In 12.9\% of collections both dead richness and dead evenness were less than live, suggesting either rapid loss of dead shells so that dead diversity is depressed below the local living community or selective loss of taphonomically vulnerable taxa. In 18.2\% of data sets dead richness was elevated but dead evenness was depressed relative to live: these are interpreted to reflect the addition of low-evenness allochthonous material. The remaining 4.5\% of data sets had elevated dead evenness but depressed dead richness, suggesting that live and dead in this case may not be closely related. In seven available time series, temporal volatility in living communities over 6–24 months was considerable but could not account for observed (mostly higher) evenness values in corresponding death assemblages, whose evenness and composition were quite stable in the few examined studies. A densely sampled spatial transect shows that changes in living-assemblage evenness along an environmental gradient were preserved in the corresponding death assemblages, although dead evenness at any location on the gradient was substantially higher than living evenness.},

	abstract = {AbstractOne of the major obstacles in dealing with any form of data derived from fossils is the effects of time-averaging, which are the result of mixing the remains of organisms that did not live contemporaneously. Although this process results in loss of temporal resolution, it also serves to filter out short-term variations. Temporal resolution of a collection depends not only on the range of fossil ages, but also on their frequency distribution. Previous studies of marine molluscs indicate that most shells in an accumulation are relatively young. Such a distribution of shell ages can be fit by an exponential curve (assuming both a constant probability of shell loss and a constant rate of shell addition), which implies that 90\% of the shells were added during the last 50\% of the time interval represented by the collection. That is to say, differences between two collections can be discerned even if they overlap 50\% in time, because the proportion of shells with shared ages is only 10\%. Applying the exponential model to previously published data suggests that long-term rates of destruction are controlled by how frequently shells from the taphonomically active zone are re-exposed to rapid destruction. To take advantage of the “noise-filtering” property of time-averaging, samples need to be large enough to catch the full range of environmental variation recorded by an accumulation. A simple probability formula indicates that samples of easily achievable size can give satisfactory time-averaged results depending on the level of confidence and sampling density defined by the researcher.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity can be divided into two aspects: richness (the number of species or other taxa in a community or sample) and evenness (a measure of the distribution of relative abundances of different taxa in a community or sample). Sample richness is typically evaluated using rarefaction, which normalizes for sample size. Evenness is typically summarized in a single value. It is shown here that Hurlbert's probability of interspecific encounter (Δ1), a commonly used sample-size independent measure of evenness, equals the slope of the steepest part of the rising limb of a rarefaction curve. This means that rarefaction curves provide information on both aspects of diversity. In addition, regional diversity (gamma) can be broken down into the diversity within local communities (alpha) and differences in taxonomic composition among local communities (beta). Beta richness is expressed by the difference between the composite rarefaction curve of all samples in a region with the collector's curve for the same samples. The differences of the initial slopes of these two curves reflect the beta evenness thanks to the relationship between rarefaction and Δ1. This relationship can be further extended to help interpret species-area curves (SAC's). As previous authors have described, rarefaction provides the null hypothesis of passive sampling for SAC's, which can be interpreted as regional collector's curves. This allows evaluation of richness and evenness at local and regional scales using a single family of well-established, mathematically related techniques.},

On the face of it, deep-time paleoecology—trying to reconstruct species interactions and the flow of matter and energy in a complex ecosystem using nothing more than the remains of long-extinct organisms—seems like folly. Fossil data are biased, time-averaged residues of once-living systems in which it is impossible to directly observe or experimentally manipulate organism interactions. This is simply the nature of historical data; what happened in the past is done and history cannot be rerun. However, just as the study of human history provides examples to understand political, social, and economic dynamics in the present day, the fossil record provides examples that have much to teach us about how modern ecosystems work. In PNAS, Aberhan and Kiessling (1) use the response of benthic marine molluscan assemblages to a severe global perturbation (the end-Cretaceous mass extinction 66 million years ago) to shed light on the complex dynamics of ecological systems.},

	abstract = {The isotope ecology of great apes is a useful reference for palaeodietary reconstructions in fossil hominins. As extant apes live in C3-dominated habitats, variation in isotope signatures is assumed to be low compared to hominoids exploiting C4-plant resources. However, isotopic differences between sites and between and within individuals are poorly understood due to the lack of vegetation baseline data. In this comparative study, we included all species of free-ranging African great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla sp.). First, we explore differences in isotope baselines across different habitats and whether isotopic signatures in apes can be related to feeding niches (faunivory and folivory). Secondly, we illustrate how stable isotopic variations within African ape populations compare to other extant and extinct primates and discuss possible implications for dietary flexibility. Using 701 carbon and nitrogen isotope data points resulting from 148 sectioned hair samples and an additional collection of 189 fruit samples, we compare six different great ape sites. We investigate the relationship between vegetation baselines and climatic variables, and subsequently correct great ape isotope data to a standardized plant baseline from the respective sites. We obtained temporal isotopic profiles of individual animals by sectioning hair along its growth trajectory. Isotopic signatures of great apes differed between sites, mainly as vegetation isotope baselines were correlated with site-specific climatic conditions. We show that controlling for plant isotopic characteristics at a given site is essential for faunal data interpretation. While accounting for plant baseline effects, we found distinct isotopic profiles for each great ape population. Based on evidence from habituated groups and sympatric great ape species, these differences could possibly be related to faunivory and folivory. Dietary flexibility in apes varied, but temporal variation was overall lower than in fossil hominins and extant baboons, shifting from C3 to C4-resources, providing new perspectives on comparisons between extinct and extant primates.},

	abstract = {Community disassembly is the non-random process of progressive species declines and losses. This process is usually studied to determine how various forces extirpate species, such as catastrophic disturbance, species invasions, habitat fragmentation, or unnatural/anthropogenic stressors. However, in ephemeral ecosystems, community disassembly is a natural and repeatable process. While many ephemeral ecosystems are aquatic (vernal pools, playa lakes, rock pools, saline lakes, phytotelmata, etc.), some disassembly patterns are applicable to other ecosystem types, including terrestrial ecosystems. As ephemeral waterbodies near the end of their hydroperiod, certain aspects fundamentally change. These fundamental changes or mechanisms cause visible patterns of community disassembly. Decreasing habitat size eliminates microhabitats and increases encounter rates between organisms, possibly increasing predation and competition. A harshening habitat eliminates low-tolerance species, changes the proportions of specialists/generalists, and forces organisms to acclimate, emigrate, or die. Additionally, ultraviolet light affects more of the water column, eliminating unprotected species. Furthermore, the entire metacommunity is often in similar stages of disassembly and collapses. Many of these mechanisms drive disassembly of terrestrial ephemeral habitats, such as animal carcasses, dung pads, or fungal fruiting bodies. Organisms obligate to ephemeral habitats have evolved to optimize their life history for a rapid lifecycle with specific adaptations for themselves or their offspring to survive through the inactive period of the ecosystem. While some disassembly may occur too fast for biotic interactions or compensatory dynamics to be important, organisms undergoing natural disassembly should “expect” it. Thus, predictions of disassembly based on internal or biotic patterns may be more common in natural disassembly scenarios than in human-induced disassembly of permanent ecosystems. Additionally, natural community disassembly should be more predictable and understandable than a permanent community's reaction to a never-before-seen anthropogenic disturbance. Community disassembly is an important ecological component of ephemeral ecosystems. The processes that occur during disassembly shape assemblages over ecologically and evolutionary relevant timescales. Understanding how natural disassembly can feed back to ultimately drive ecosystem structure and function increases our knowledge of fundamental ecology and provides for a new frontier of study.

	abstract = {The causes of biodiversity patterns are controversial and elusive due to complex environmental variation, covarying changes in communities, and lack of baseline and null theories to differentiate straightforward causes from more complex mechanisms. To address these limitations, we developed general diversity theory integrating metabolic principles with niche-based community assembly. We evaluated this theory by investigating patterns in the diversity and distribution of soil bacteria taxa across four orders of magnitude variation in spatial scale on an Antarctic mountainside in low complexity, highly oligotrophic soils. Our theory predicts that lower temperatures should reduce taxon niche widths along environmental gradients due to decreasing growth rates, and the changing niche widths should lead to contrasting α- and β-diversity patterns. In accord with the predictions, α-diversity, niche widths and occupancies decreased while β-diversity increased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. The theory also successfully predicts a hump-shaped relationship between α-diversity and pH and a negative relationship between α-diversity and salinity. Thus, a few simple principles explained systematic microbial diversity variation along multiple gradients. Such general theory can be used to disentangle baseline effects from more complex effects of temperature and other variables on biodiversity patterns in a variety of ecosystems and organisms.},

This match of predator and prey is thought to be particularly critical for the vulnerable larval life stages of many fish, where limited parental investment means that population survival can depend on how well larvae match the timing of their food. We develop and apply novel metrics of thermal time to estimate the timing of unobserved stages of fish larvae and their prey across the north Atlantic. The result shows that previously identified life-history strategies are adaptive in that they allow parents to “predict” a beneficial environment for their offspring and meet larval fish food timing that varies by 99 days across a species’ range.
Adult fish ensure that their young do not starve by timing reproduction so that food is available when their young need it.

In addition to steady increase in knowledge through new fossil discoveries, increasing attention is being given to ecological and evolutionary processes, and there is growing concern with theory and principles in both the biological and geological aspects of paleontology. There is, however, a neglect of comparative morphology and taxonomy, and there are far too few expert paleontologists to cover the work to be done. For a qualified few who recognize the challenge, opportunities are almost unlimited in paleontology for significant studies of comparative morphology, systematics, evolution, stratigraphic facies, paleoclimatology, and the general history of life. The utilitarian value of fossils as stratigraphic indicators is, and will always be, an important aspect of paleontology. But, as requirements become ever more exacting, stratigraphic paleontology calls for skilled preparation of fossils and expert knowledge of their biological nature beyond the abilities of the non-specialist. Intensive stratigraphic studies in all parts of the world, and the development of improved methods of collecting and preparing fossils have revealed a fossil record much richer than was envisioned by the founders of the Paleontological Society. There are now substantial reasons for believing that the available record is still very incompletely known. Much remains to be learned about the processes by which organisms are preserved as fossils.},

	abstract = {Although forest succession has traditionally been approached as a deterministic process, successional trajectories of vegetation change vary widely, even among nearby stands with similar environmental conditions and disturbance histories. Here, we provide the first attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify predictability and uncertainty during succession based on the most extensive long-term datasets ever assembled for Neotropical forests. We develop a novel approach that integrates deterministic and stochastic components into different candidate models describing the dynamical interactions among three widely used and interrelated forest attributes—stem density, basal area, and species density. Within each of the seven study sites, successional trajectories were highly idiosyncratic, even when controlling for prior land use, environment, and initial conditions in these attributes. Plot factors were far more important than stand age in explaining successional trajectories. For each site, the best-fit model was able to capture the complete set of time series in certain attributes only when both the deterministic and stochastic components were set to similar magnitudes. Surprisingly, predictability of stem density, basal area, and species density did not show consistent trends across attributes, study sites, or land use history, and was independent of plot size and time series length. The model developed here represents the best approach, to date, for characterizing autogenic successional dynamics and demonstrates the low predictability of successional trajectories. These high levels of uncertainty suggest that the impacts of allogenic factors on rates of change during tropical forest succession are far more pervasive than previously thought, challenging the way ecologists view and investigate forest regeneration.},

	abstract = {The host specificity, taxonomic composition and feeding guild of rare species were studied in communities of herbivorous insects in New Guinea. Leaf-chewing and sap-sucking insects (Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hemiptera-Auchenorrhyncha) were sampled from 30 species of trees and shrubs (15 spp. of Ficus, Moraceae, six spp. of Macaranga and nine species of other Euphorbiaceae) in a lowland rain forest. Feeding trials were performed with all leaf-chewers in order to exclude transient species. Overall, the sampling produced 80 062 individuals of 1050 species. The species accumulation curve did not attain an asymptote, despite 950 person-days of sampling. Rare species, defined as those found as single individuals, remained numerous even in large samples and after the exclusion of transient, non-feeding species. There was no difference among plant species in the proportion of rare species in their herbivore communities, which was, on average, 45\%. Likewise, various herbivore guilds and taxa had all very similar proportions of rare and common species. There was also no difference between rare and common species in their host specificity. Both highly specialised species and generalists, feeding on numerous plants, contributed to the singleton records on particular plant species. Predominantly, a species was rare on a particular host whilst more common on other, often related, host species, or relatively rare on numerous other host plants, so that its aggregate population was high. Both cases are an example of the “mass effect”, since it is probable that such rare species were dependent on a constant influx of immigrants from the other host plants. These other plants were found particularly often among congeneric plants, less so among confamilial plants from different genera and least frequently among plants from different families. There were also 278 very rare species, found as one individual on a single plant species only. Their host specificity could not be assessed; they might have been either very rare specialists, or species feeding also on other plants, those that were not studied. The former possibility is unlikely since monophagous species, collected as singletons at the present sampling effort, would have existed at an extremely low population density, less than 1 individual per 10 ha of the forest.},

	abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

	abstract = {Preservation of the stable carbon isotopic composition of fossil tooth enamel enables us to estimate the relative proportion of C3 versus C4 vegetation in an animal's diet, which, combined with analysis of faunal abundance, may provide complementary methods of paleoenvironmental reconstruction. To this end, we analyzed stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C values) of tooth enamel from four bovid tribes (Tragelaphini, Aepycerotini, Reduncini, and Alcelaphini) derived from six members of the Shungura Formation (Members B, C, D, F, G, and L; ages from ca. 2.90–1.05 Ma (millions of years ago) in the Lower Omo Valley of southwestern Ethiopia. The bovids show a wide range of δ13C values within taxa and stratigraphic members, as well as temporal changes in the feeding strategies of taxa analyzed throughout the middle to late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. Such variation suggests that the use of actualistic approaches for paleoenvironmental reconstruction may not always be warranted. Alcelaphini was the only taxon analyzed that retained a consistent dietary preference throughout the sequence, with entirely C4-dominated diets. Reduncini had a mixed C3/C4 to C4-dominated diet prior to 2.4 Ma, after which this taxon shifted to a largely C4-dominated diet. Aepycerotini generally showed a mixed C3/C4 diet, with a period of increased C4 diet from 2.5 to 2.3 Ma. Tragelaphini showed a range of mixed C3/C4 diets, with a median value that was briefly nearer the C4 end member from 2.9 to 2.4 Ma but was otherwise towards the C3 end member. These isotopic results, combined with relative abundance data for these bovids, imply that the environment of the Lower Omo Valley consisted of a mosaic of closed woodlands, with riverine forests and open grasslands. However, our data also signify that the overall environment gradually became more open, and that C4 grasses became more dominant. Finally, these results help document the range and extent of environments and potential diets that were available to the four hominin species encountered in the Shungura sequence.},

	abstract = {1.Ecological disturbances are often hypothesized to alter community assembly processes that influence variation in community composition (β-diversity). Disturbance can cause convergence in community composition (low β-diversity) by increasing niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Alternatively, disturbance can cause divergence in community composition (high β-diversity) by increasing habitat filtering across environmental gradients. However, because disturbance may also influence β-diversity through random sampling effects owing to changes in the number of individuals in local communities (community size) or abundances in the regional species pool, observed patterns of β-diversity alone cannot be used to unambiguously discern the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. 2.We compared β-diversity of woody plants and inferred assembly mechanisms among unburned forests and forests managed with prescribed fires in the Missouri Ozarks, USA. Using a null-model approach, we compared how environmental gradients influenced β-diversity after controlling for differences in local community size and regional species abundances between unburned and burned landscapes. 3.Observed β-diversity was higher in burned landscapes. However, this pattern disappeared or reversed after controlling for smaller community size in burned landscapes. 4.β-diversity was higher than expected by chance in both landscapes, indicating an important role for processes that create clumped species distributions. Moreover, fire appeared to decrease clumping of species at broader spatial scales, suggesting homogenization of community composition through niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Environmental variables, however, explained similar amounts of variation in β-diversity in both landscapes, suggesting that disturbance did not alter the relative importance of habitat filtering. 5.Our results indicate that contingent responses of communities to fire reflect a combination of fire-induced changes in local community size and scale-dependent effects of fire on species clumping across landscapes. 6.Synthesis. Although niche-based mechanisms of community assembly are often invoked to explain changes in community composition following disturbance, our results suggest that these changes also arise through random sampling effects owing to the influence of disturbance on community size. Comparative studies of these processes across disturbed ecosystems will provide important insights into the ecological conditions that determine when disturbance alters the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes in natural and human-modified landscapes.

	abstract = {Recent research reports that many populations of species showing a wide trophic niche (generalists) are made up of both generalist individuals and individuals with a narrow trophic niche (specialists), suggesting trophic specializations at an individual level. If true, foraging strategies should be associated with individual quality and fitness. Optimal foraging theory predicts that individuals will select the most favourable habitats for feeding. In addition, the “landscape heterogeneity hypothesis” predicts a higher number of species in more diverse landscapes. Thus, it can be predicted that individuals with a wider realized trophic niche should have foraging territories with greater habitat diversity, suggesting that foraging strategies, territory quality and habitat diversity are inter-correlated. This was tested for a population of common kestrels Falco tinnunculus. Diet diversity, territory occupancy (as a measure of territory quality) and habitat diversity of territories were measured over an 8-year period. Our results show that: 1) territory quality was quadratically correlated with habitat diversity, with the best territories being the least and most diverse; 2) diet diversity was not correlated with territory quality; and 3) diet diversity was negatively correlated with landscape heterogeneity. Our study suggests that niche generalist foraging strategies are based on an active search for different prey species within or between habitats rather than on the selection of territories with high habitat diversity.},

	abstract = {Ecological observations and paleontological data show that communities of organisms recur in space and time. Various observations suggest that communities largely disappear in extinction events and appear during radiations. This hypothesis, however, has not been tested on a large scale due to a lack of methods for analyzing fossil data, identifying communities, and quantifying their turnover. We demonstrate an approach for quantifying turnover of communities over the Phanerozoic Eon. Using network analysis of fossil occurrence data, we provide the first estimates of appearance and disappearance rates for marine animal paleocommunities in the 100 stages of the Phanerozoic record. Our analysis of 124,605 fossil collections (representing 25,749 living and extinct marine animal genera) shows that paleocommunity disappearance and appearance rates are generally highest in mass extinctions and recovery intervals, respectively, with rates three times greater than background levels. Although taxonomic change is, in general, a fair predictor of ecologic reorganization, the variance is high, and ecologic and taxonomic changes were episodically decoupled at times in the past. Extinction rate, therefore, is an imperfect proxy for ecologic change. The paleocommunity turnover rates suggest that efforts to assess the ecological consequences of the present-day biodiversity crisis should focus on the selectivity of extinctions and changes in the prevalence of biological interactions.},

	abstract = {Aim We analysed spatial datasets of abundance across the entirety, or near entirety, of the geographical ranges of 134 tree species to test macroecological hypotheses concerning the distribution of abundance across geographical ranges. Location Our abundance estimates came via the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Eastwide Database, which contains data for 134 eastern North American tree species. Methods We extracted measures of range size and the spatial location of abundance relative to position in the range for each species to test four hypotheses: (a) species occur in low abundance throughout most of their geographical range; (b) there is a positive interspecific relationship between abundance and range size; (c) species are more abundant in the centre of their range; and (d) there is a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance across a species range. Results Our results demonstrate that (a) most species (85\%) are abundant somewhere in their geographical range; (b) species achieving relatively high abundance tend to have larger range sizes; (c) the widely held assumption that species exhibit an ‘abundant-centre distribution’ is not well supported for the majority of species; we suggest ‘abundant-core’ as a more suitable term; and (d) there is no evidence of a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance. Main Conclusions For many tree species, high abundance can be achieved at any position in the range, though suitable sites are found with less frequency towards range edges. Competitive relationships may be involved in the distribution of abundance across tree ranges and species with larger ranges (and possibly broader niches) may be affected more by biotic interactions than smaller ranging species.},

We then asked the question: What proportion of tail species within a given community are constitutive members of the tail everywhere throughout their geographical range, versus what proportion are found as substantially more abundant somewhere within their range? Out of 55 tail species identified from dry sclerophyll woodland and 116 tail species identified from temperate rain forest, 91\% and 95\%, respectively, were significantly more abundant at other locations (“somewhere-abundant” species), versus 9\% and 5\% “everywhere-sparse” species. Among eight attributes in dry sclerophyll woodland and nine attributes in temperate rain forest compared between somewhere-abundant and everywhere-sparse species, none discriminated consistently between the two groups of species. The size and dispersal morphology of seeds, flowering and fruiting durations and seasons, regeneration strategy after fire, size of geographical ranges, maximum plant height, and size class revealed no consistent distinctions. For the small minority of species that are everywhere-sparse, some general explanation may exist as to why they are in the tail of rank–abundance curves, though none was located among the attributes compared in this paper. For the majority of tail species that are somewhere-abundant, any explanation as to why they are in the tail will need to account for different outcomes in different places.},

The common practice so far has been to examine alternative assembly theories using dichotomist approaches of the form neutrality versus niche, or compensatory dynamics versus environmental forcing. In reality, all these mechanisms will be operating, albeit with different strengths. While there have been different approaches to community structure and dynamics, including neutrality and niche differentiation, less work has gone into separating out the temporal variation in species abundances into relative contributions from different components. Here we use a refined statistical machinery to decompose temporal fluctuations in species abundances into contributions from environmental stochasticity and inter-/intraspecific interactions, to see which ones dominate. We apply the methodology to community data from a range of taxa. Our results show that communities are largely driven by environmental fluctuations, and that member populations are, to different extents, regulated through intraspecific interactions, the effects of interspecific interactions remaining broadly minor. By decomposing the temporal variation in this way, we have been able to show directly what has been previously inferred indirectly: compensatory dynamics are in fact largely outweighed by environmental forcing, and the latter tends to synchronize the population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Events in primate evolution are often dated by assuming a constant rate of substitution per unit time, but the validity of this assumption remains unclear. Among mammals, it is well known that there exists substantial variation in yearly substitution rates. Such variation is to be expected from differences in life history traits, suggesting it should also be found among primates. Motivated by these considerations, we analyze whole genomes from 10 primate species, including Old World Monkeys (OWMs), New World Monkeys (NWMs), and apes, focusing on putatively neutral autosomal sites and controlling for possible effects of biased gene conversion and methylation at CpG sites. We find that substitution rates are up to 64\% higher in lineages leading from the hominoid–NWM ancestor to NWMs than to apes. Within apes, rates are ∼2\% higher in chimpanzees and ∼7\% higher in the gorilla than in humans. Substitution types subject to biased gene conversion show no more variation among species than those not subject to it. Not all mutation types behave similarly, however; in particular, transitions at CpG sites exhibit a more clocklike behavior than do other types, presumably because of their nonreplicative origin. Thus, not only the total rate, but also the mutational spectrum, varies among primates. This finding suggests that events in primate evolution are most reliably dated using CpG transitions. Taking this approach, we estimate the human and chimpanzee divergence time is 12.1 million years,​ and the human and gorilla divergence time is 15.1 million years​.},

This paper provides new radiometric dates by electron spin resonance applied to optically bleached quartz grains for the whole stratigraphic sequence.

Recent geological fieldwork, radiometric age dating of volcanic rocks, gravity and seismic reflection surveys have considerably refined our understanding of the tectonic evolution of the northern Kenya Rift. These data reveal that deep, half-graben basins up to 7 km thick were initiated west of Lake Turkana probably during Late Oligocene-Early Miocene times. The basins, bounded by easterly dipping faults, trend along the western side of the rift from Lake Turkana to the Elgayo Escarpment-Tugen Hills area. Some rift basins were episodically active from the Oligocene to the Pliocene while others were only active for a few million years. Some sag basins may have developed during periods of rifting quiescence. In the Turkana area the location of faulting gradually shifted eastwards with time. Volcanism both preceded and accompanied rifting. Within the Turkana area, volcanism moved south and east with time, beginning about 33 Ma (probably preceding half graben formation by a few million years) and continued to the present day. Extension along faults is greater in the Turkana area (between 25-40 km) and decreases southwards to probably 5-10 km or less in the southern Kenya rift. This pattern of extension values agrees with deep seismic refraction work (KRISP), which indicates thin crust in the Turkana area (about 20 km) that thickens to about 35 km south of Lake Baringo. The extension values, crustal thinning, age of volcanism and the timing of faulting to the south all point towards a southerly propagation of the rift.},

	abstract = {A synthesis of community and ecosystem ecology should yield insights into the role of species in ecosystem function. Concepts from these subdisciplines of ecology, specifically species compensation and ecosystem homeostasis, can be linked by analyzing the effect of changes in the abundance of species on ecosystem processes. Compensatory changes in species populations in response to environmental fluctuations can maintain an approximate steady state between rates of resource supply and resource consumption. We predict that ecosystem-level properties, such as species richness, total population, biomass, and energy use, will exhibit less variability in response to environmental change than will species composition. We tested this prediction using long-term data of a desert rodent community responding to natural environmental fluctuations and of a plant community responding to experimental manipulations. For the rodents, species composition was twice as variable as the ecosystem properties. This result was the same for both the analysis of variability around the 22-yr average and the analysis of variability from one time period to the next. For the plant communities, species composition was more variable among treatments in most years than stem count or species richness. Using the variance ratio proposed by J. L. Klug et al. we detected negative covariances in the rodent community, confirming the presence of compensatory dynamics.},

Although human ecology is unusual in many respects, human populations also face energetic constraints. Here we present a model relating fertility rates to per capita energy consumption rates in contemporary human nations. Fertility declines as energy consumption increases with a scaling exponent of −1/3 as predicted by allometric theory. The decline may be explained by parental trade-offs between the number of children and the energetic investment in each child. We hypothesize that the −1/3 exponent results from the scaling properties of the networked infrastructure that delivers energy to consumers. This allometric analysis of human fertility offers a framework for understanding the demographic transition to smaller family sizes, with implications for human population growth, resource use and sustainability.},

	abstract = {. The average amount of variance explained by the main factor of interest in ecological and evolutionary studies is an important quantity because it allows evaluation of the general strength of research findings. It also has important implications for the planning of studies. Theoretically we should be able to explain 100\% of the variance in data, but randomness and noise may reduce this amount considerably in biological studies. We performed a meta-analysis using data from 43 published meta-analyses in ecology and evolution with 93 estimates of mean effect size using Pearson's r and 136 estimates using Hedges' d or g. This revealed that (depending on the exact analysis) the mean amount of variance (r2) explained was 2.51–5.42\%. The various 95\% confidence intervals fell between 1.99 and 7.05\%. There was a strongly positive relationship between the fail-safe number (the number of null results needed to nullify an effect) and the coefficient of determination (r2) or effect size. Analysis at the level of individual tests of null hypotheses showed that the amount of variance key factors explained differed among fields with the largest amount in physiological ecology, lower amounts in ecology and the lowest in evolutionary studies. In all fields though, the hypothesized relationship (e.g. main effect of a fixed treatment) explained little of the variation in the trait of interest. Our finding has important implications for the interpretation of scientific studies. Across studies, the average effect size reported is between Pearson r=0.180 and 0.193 and Hedges' d=0.631 and 0.721. Thus the average sample sizes needed to conclude that a particular relationship is absent with a power of 80\% and α=0.05 (two-tailed) are considerably larger than usually recorded in studies of evolution and ecology. For example, to detect r=0.193, the required sample size is 207.},

Here we present food web data from 115 salt marsh islands and show that network structure is associated with the number of functional groups present. Functional group diversity is heterogeneously distributed across spatial scales, with some islands hosting more functional groups than others. Functional groups form modules within the community so that food webs with more modular architectures have more functional group diversity. Further, in communities with different interaction types, modularity can be seen as the multifunctional equivalent of trophic complementarity. Collectively, these findings reveal spatial heterogeneity in the number of functional groups that emerges from patterns in the structure of the food web.},

	abstract = {While the human brain is clearly large relative to body size, less is known about the timing of brain and brain component expansion within primates and the relative magnitude of volumetric increases. Using Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods and data for both extant and fossil species, we identified that a distinct shift in brain-body scaling occurred as hominins diverged from other primates, and again as humans and Neanderthals diverged from other hominins. Within hominins, we detected a pattern of directional and accelerating evolution towards larger brains, consistent with a positive feedback process in the evolution of the human brain. Contrary to widespread assumptions, we found that the human neocortex is not exceptionally large relative to other brain structures. Instead, our analyses revealed a single increase in relative neocortex volume at the origin of haplorrhines, and an increase in relative cerebellar volume in apes.
          , 
            Humans have much larger brains than other primates, but it is not clear exactly when and how this difference emerged during evolution. Some scientists believe that the expansion of a part of the brain called the neocortex – which handles sight, hearing, conscious decision-making and language – drove the increase in the size of the human brain. Newer studies have challenged that idea.
            One way to learn more about how humans evolved bigger brains is to compare the size of the brain, and specific parts of the brain, between humans and our closest relatives: non-human primates. To make accurate comparisons, scientists must account for many factors. Closely related primates may have more similar traits because they more recently shared a common ancestor. This means the evolutionary relationships between species need to be considered. Larger animals also tend to have larger brains so it is important to consider body size, too.
            Now, Miller at al. show that the human brain is much larger than expected even after accounting for these factors, and that increases in brain size accelerated over the course of early human evolution. In the analyses, the brain and skull sizes of different living primate species, like chimpanzees and gorillas, and fossils of extinct primates, including Neanderthals, were compared using mathematical models.
            These findings suggest that larger brains provided fitness advantages that led to large brain sizes in modern humans and Neanderthals. These increases in brain size were not driven by disproportionate growth in the neocortex alone, but rather by increases in the size of many parts of the brain. Increases in the relative size of the cerebellum, which is essential for balance and movement, were also important.},

Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

	abstract = {Understanding how biotic communities respond to landscape spatial structure is critically important for conservation management as natural landscapes become increasingly fragmented. However, empirical studies of the effects of spatial structure on plant species richness have found inconsistent results, suggesting that more comprehensive approaches are needed. In this study, we asked how landscape structure affects total plant species richness and the richness of a guild of specialized plants in a multivariate context. We sampled herbaceous plant communities at 56 dolomite glades (insular, fire-adapted grasslands) across the Missouri Ozarks, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relative importance of landscape structure, soil resource availability, and fire history for plant communities. We found that landscape spatial structure-defined as the area-weighted proximity of glade habitat surrounding study sites (proximity index)-had a significant effect on total plant species richness, but only after we controlled for environmental covariates. Richness of specialist species, but not generalists, was positively related to landscape spatial structure. Our results highlight that local environmental filters must be considered to understand the influence of landscape structure on communities, and that unique species guilds may respond differently to landscape structure than the community as a whole. These findings suggest that both local environment and landscape context should be considered when developing management strategies for species of conservation concern in fragmented habitats.},

	abstract = {A key problem in ecology is to predict the presence–absence of species across a geographical region. Dispersal is thought to have an important influence on the range limits of species, and understanding this problem in a multi-species community with priority effects (i.e. initial abundances determine the presence–absence of species) is a challenging task because dispersal interacts with biotic and abiotic factors as well as demographic stochasticity. By using stochastic individual-based models (IBM) and deterministic models consisting of biotic interactions and environmental gradients, we investigate the joint effects of dispersal and stochasticity on the occurrence of priority effects that can shape the presence–absence of multiple species. Our analysis shows the conditions under which priority effects occur and disappear as dispersal intensity changes. Without dispersal, priority effects emerge in the presence of intense biotic interactions; only one species surviving at any given location, with no overlap in their ranges. Inclusion of dispersal first reduces the prevalence of priority effects (i.e. for weak dispersal), and then leads to their increase (i.e. for moderate dispersal); consequently, dispersal enhances the possibility for species ranges to overlap. Increasing dispersal strength above a threshold value leads to the disappearance of priority effects and causes extinction of some species. We also demonstrate contrasting observations of stochasticity on priority effects: while this phenomenon is more prevalent in the stochastic IBM than in the deterministic models for large populations, we observe fewer occurrences of priority effects in IBM for small populations; in particular, our IBM results show that priority effects are eliminated by weaker values of dispersal when population sizes are small than when they are large. This situation can induce an uncertainty in the predictions of species presence–absence. Overall, our results demonstrate how the interplay of dispersal and stochasticity can combine to result in the (dis-)appearance of priority effects that strongly determine the presence–absence of species.},

The abundance of corals is declining at multiple scales, and the species composition of assemblages is responding to escalating human pressures, including anthropogenic global warming. An urgent challenge is to understand the functional consequences of these shifts in abundance and composition in different biogeographical contexts. While global patterns of coral species richness are well known, the biogeography of coral functions in provinces and domains with high and low redundancy is poorly understood. Here, we quantify the functional traits of all currently recognized zooxanthellate coral species (n = 821) in both the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic domains to examine the relationships between species richness and the diversity and redundancy of functional trait space. We find that trait diversity is remarkably conserved ({\textgreater}75\% of the global total) along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species richness, falling away only in species-poor provinces (n {\textless} 200), such as the Persian Gulf (52\% of the global total), Hawaii (37\%), the Caribbean (26\%), and the East-Pacific (20\%), where redundancy is also diminished. In the more species-poor provinces, large and ecologically important areas of trait space are empty, or occupied by just a few, highly distinctive species. These striking biogeographical differences in redundancy could affect the resilience of critical reef functions and highlight the vulnerability of relatively depauperate, peripheral locations, which are often a low priority for targeted conservation efforts.},

Abstract
Despite the increasing importance of functional traits for the study of plant ecology, we do not know how variation in a given trait changes across ecological scales, which prevents us from assessing potential scale-dependent aspects of trait variation. To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

However, previous efforts to constrain this tuff record, especially for Olduvai Bed II, have been limited because of erosion, contamination, reworking, and the alteration of volcanic glass under saline-alkaline conditions. This paper applies previously defined geochemical and mineralogical “fingerprints” for several major Bed II marker tuffs, based on glass (where available) and phenocrysts more resistant to alteration (feldspar, hornblende, augite, and titanomagnetite), to tuffs from stratigraphic sections in the Olduvai Junction Area, including previously and recently excavated Acheulean and Oldowan sites (HWK EE (Locality (Loc) 42), EF-HR (Loc 12a), FLK (Loc 45), and MNK (Loc 88)). The Middle Bed II Bird Print Tuff (BPT) is found to be more compositionally variable than previously reported but is still valuable as a stratigraphic marker over short distances. The confirmation of blocks of Tuff IID in conglomerate helps constrain Upper Bed II stratigraphy at sites where in-situ tuffs are absent. This paper also compiles the results of published geochronological research, providing stratigraphic context and updating previously reported dates using a consistent 40Ar/39Ar reference standard age. The results of this work support the following paleoanthropologically relevant conclusions: 1) the early Acheulean site EF-HR (Loc 12a) is situated above the level of Hay's Tuff IIC, and thus sits in Upper rather than Middle Bed II, (2) the HWK EE (Loc 42) Oldowan site is constrained between Tuff IIA and Tuff IIB, just above the boundary between Lower and Middle Bed II, and 3) the Acheulean site at FLK W most likely lies within the Middle Augitic Sandstone, above Tuff IIB, similar to the placements by Leakey and Hay for the earliest Acheulean at Olduvai.},

	abstract = {Abstract:   We are now entering a time of immense environmental upheaval in which, increasingly, experts are required to provide conservation assessments. Quantitative assessment of trends in species' range and abundance is costly, requiring extensive field studies over a long period of time. Unfortunately, many species are only known through a few “chance” sightings or a handful of specimens, and therefore extinction may be even harder to ascertain. Several methods have been proposed for estimating the probability of extinction. However, comparison within and between species is difficult because of variations in sighting rates. We applied a probabilistic method that incorporates sighting rate to the sighting record of Vietnamese slipper orchids (Paphiopedilum). The method generates a probability that another sighting will occur given the previous sighting rate and the time since last observation. This allows greater comparability between species discovered at different times. Its predictions were more highly correlated with the World Conservation Union criteria than previous methods. Trends in data collection and the political climate of a country, which affects access to material, are important potential sources of variation that affect sighting rates. A lack of understanding of the process by which data are generated makes inferring extinction from sighting records difficult because extinction status depends on how the sighting rate varies. However, such methods allow rapid conservation prioritization of taxa that are poorly known and would otherwise go unassessed.},

	abstract = {A quantitative model describes the relationship between the average size of biostratigraphic gaps and the size, shape, and number of fossils in a volume of rock: where fossil distribution is random, the mean vertical distance between neighboring fossils exposed in cross-sections (V) should be approximated by the relationship 1/Na(w) where Na is the number of fossils exposed per unit area and w is the width of section observed. Because the number exposed (Na) is itself a function of volumetric fossil abundance (Nv), fossil shape (K), and fossil size (x), we can go further and relate gaps to these factors as well. Thus, V = 1/(Nv)(k)(x)(w). Testing and analysis of this model reveal that: (1) Gap size decreases (and so biostratigraphic resolution increases) as abundance, sphericity, and size of fossils increase; this is because each of these proportionately increases the probability of fossil exposure by a random cross-sectional "slice." (2) The "hollow curve" nature of the function means that where volumetric abundance is low, small increases in abundance can greatly reduce gap size, but as overall abundance increases, gap size is proportionately less and less affected so that after a point even large increases in abundance have almost no effect on biostratigraphic resolution. For smaller fossils, this stabilization occurs at much larger gap sizes than for larger fossils. However, this can be offset by increasing section width observed. (3) Biostratigraphy essentially "collapses" fossils onto a vertical reference axis, eliminating the horizontal component of their position in two-dimensional space. This is a cumulative process so that all fossils in a section are quickly crowded on the axis, creating a very low mean gap size. The combination of random positioning and very low mean causes the gaps to follow the Poisson distribution often noted in field data. A number of practical uses derive from these observations.},

Substantial consistency appears across ecological and geological time scales in such traits. Evolutionary branching produces phylogenetic (as often measured by taxonomic) nesting of extinction-biasing traits at many scales. An example is the tendency, seen in both fossil and modern data, for higher taxa living in marine habitats to have generally lower species extinction rates. At lower taxononomic levels, recent bird and mammal extinctions are concentrated in certain genera and families. A fundamental result of such selectivity is that it can accelerate net loss of biodiversity compared to random loss of species among taxa.

Recent work by Vogel has shown that the latter date can be disregarded. Our excavations of Taung deposits from 1988 to 1992, under the direction of P. V. Tobias, have revealed more fauna and geological information with which we can make a more accurate assessment of the faunal age than was possible with cercopithecids alone.

	abstract = {Host fitness is impacted by trillions of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract that facilitate development and are inextricably tied to life history. During development, microbial colonization primes the gut metabolism and physiology, thereby setting the stage for adult nutrition and health. However, the ecological rules governing microbial succession are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the relationship between host lineage, captive diet, and life stage and gut microbiota characteristics in three primate species (infraorder, Lemuriformes). Fecal samples were collected from captive lemur mothers and their infants, from birth to weaning. Microbial DNA was extracted and the v4 region of 16S rDNA was sequenced on the Illumina platform using protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project. Here, we show that colonization proceeds along different successional trajectories in developing infants from species with differing dietary regimes and ecological profiles: frugivorous (fruit-eating) Varecia variegata, generalist Lemur catta, and folivorous (leaf-eating) Propithecus coquereli. Our analyses reveal community membership and succession patterns consistent with previous studies of human infants, suggesting that lemurs may serve as a useful model of microbial ecology in the primate gut. Each lemur species exhibits distinct species-specific bacterial diversity signatures correlating to life stages and life history traits, implying that gut microbial community assembly primes developing infants at species-specific rates for their respective adult feeding strategies.},

	abstract = {The discovery of several associated body parts of early hominids whose taxonomic identity is known inspires this study of body size and proportions in early hominids. The approach consists of finding the relationship between various measures of skeletal size and body mass in modern ape and human specimens of known body weight. This effort leads to 78 equations which predict body weight from 95 fossil specimens ranging in geological age between 4 and 1.4 mya. Predicted weights range from 10 kg to over 160 kg, but the partial associated skeletons provide the essential clues as to which predictions are most reliable. Measures of hindlimb joint size are the best and probably those equations based on the human samples are better than those based on all Hominoidea. Using hindlimb joint size of specimens of relatively certain taxonomy and assuming these measures were more like those of modern humans than of apes, the male and female averages are as follows: Australopithecus afarensis, 45 and 29 kg; A. africanus, 41 and 30 kg; A. robustus, 40 and 32 kg; A. boisei, 49 and 34 kg; H. habilis, 52 and 32 kg. These values appear to be consistent with the range of size variation seen in the entire postcranial samples that can be assigned to species. If hominoid (i.e., ape and human combined) proportions are assumed, the males would be 10 to 23 kg larger and the females 4 to 10 kg larger.},

	abstract = {Understanding and predicting how species' distributions will shift as climate changes are central questions in ecology today. The late Quaternary of North America represents a natural experiment in which we can evaluate how species responded during the expansion and contraction of the glaciers. Here, we ask whether species' range shifts differ because of taxonomic affinity, life-history traits, body size or topographic heterogeneity and whether the species survived the megafaunal extinction. There was no difference in range shifts between victims and survivors of the megafaunal extinction. In general, the change in the size of a species' range is not well correlated with any of the ecological or life-history traits evaluated. However, there are significant relationships between some variables and the movements of the centroids of ranges. Differences in the distances shifted exist among orders, although this is probably a result of body size differences as larger bodied species show larger shifts. Although there are a few exceptions, the distance that species shifted their range was weakly correlated with life-history traits. Finally, species in more topographically heterogeneous areas show smaller shifts than species in less-diverse areas. Overall, these results indicate that when trying to predict species range shifts in the future, body size, lifespan and the topographic relief of the landscape should be taken into account.},

	abstract = {The latitudinal gradient of species richness is well documented for a variety of taxa in both terrestrial and aquatic environs. Moreover, a number of recent attempts to assess the effects of scale on the relationship have concluded that the latitudinal pattern is scale-invariant. Nonetheless, the power of those approaches is predicated on precise knowledge of the forms of the latitudinal gradient, the area relationship, and their interaction. We used a model developed by J. Pastor, A. Downing, and H. E. Erickson for assessing the effects of scale on the productivity–diversity gradient to avoid such complications. More specifically, for 253 sets of nested quadrats (1000–25 000 km2) located throughout the New World, we parameterized the power function and determined whether those parameters varied in a systematic fashion with latitude. Significant latitude-induced monotonic variation in the rate of species accumulation with area (z parameter) documented scale-sensitivity for both bats and marsupials, with z decreasing toward tropical latitudes. Variation in the intercept parameter (C) reflected the latitudinal gradient in richness after adjustment for the latitude-specific effects of area. Both bats and marsupials exhibited strong gradients of richness, with modal values in the tropics. Mechanisms affecting species richness, or the size of ranges and the juxtapositioning of their boundaries, may initiate scale-sensitivity in many systems. A number of mechanistic or phenomenological models (environmental, geometric constraint, and Rapoport-rescue hypotheses) thought to produce the latitudinal gradient also enhance the likelihood of scale-sensitivity. Consequently, investigations of other macroecological gradients of richness (e.g., elevation, depth, and productivity) that should be affected by such factors are probably also scale-sensitive.},

	abstract = {A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential. The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages, including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids. Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other mammals and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are artifacts of temporal scaling.},

            The concept of evolvability—the capacity of a population to produce and maintain evolutionarily relevant variation—has become increasingly prominent in evolutionary biology. Paleontology has a long history of investigating questions of evolvability, but paleontological thinking has tended to neglect recent discussions, because many tools used in the current evolvability literature are challenging to apply to the fossil record. The fundamental difficulty is how to disentangle whether the causes of evolutionary patterns arise from variational properties of traits or lineages rather than being due to selection and ecological success. Despite these obstacles, the fossil record offers unique and growing sources of data that capture evolutionary patterns of sustained duration and significance otherwise inaccessible to evolutionary biologists. Additionally, there exist a variety of strategic possibilities for combining prominent neontological approaches to evolvability with those from paleontology. We illustrate three of these possibilities with quantitative genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, and phylogenetic models of macroevolution. In conclusion, we provide a methodological schema that focuses on the conceptualization, measurement, and testing of hypotheses to motivate and provide guidance for future empirical and theoretical studies of evolvability in the fossil record.},

However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.},

	abstract = {Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities, but it is difficult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species richness estimators. The study was carried out in ∼1500 ha of lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in sample-based rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12\% of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by “edge effects”: “methodological edge species” (possibly abundant at the site but difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and “geographic edge species,” known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the 51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries. Only six species were “global uniques,” known to date from only one sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and extensive effort are applied.},

This study explored morphological diversity among Carboniferous arthropods, primarily from the well-known Westphalian Mazon Creek Lagerstätte. Over 100 arthropod species, belonging to 48 orders, were examined. The data set is composed of nearly equal numbers of crustacean, arachnid, and insect species, with lower numbers of merostomes. Trilobites have not been found at Mazon Creek. However, some Late Carboniferous trilobite species were included in order to obtain a more representative picture of global Carboniferous arthropod disparity. The absence, presence, or state of 66 shared characters was recorded for each species, as well as individual autapomorphies. Overall disparity was determined from the Euclidean distance analysis between taxa or variance along principal coordinates analyses (PCO) axes. Results indicate that arthropod disparity has not been greatly reduced throughout the Phanerozoic as was previously suggested. However, the regions of occupied morphospace have rotated over time.},

This individual is similar to others from the site but supplies information about variation in brain size and craniofacial anatomy within the Dmanisi paleodeme. Although this assemblage presents numerous primitive characters, the Dmanisi skulls are best accommodated within the species H. erectus. On anatomical grounds, it is argued that the relatively small-brained and lightly built Dmanisi hominins may be ancestral to African and Far Eastern branches of H. erectus showing more derived morphology.

Here we report on a new cranium from Dmanisi (D4500) that, together with its mandible (D2600), represents the world's first completely preserved adult hominid skull from the early Pleistocene. D4500/D2600 combines a small braincase (546 cubic centimeters) with a large prognathic face and exhibits close morphological affinities with the earliest known Homo fossils from Africa. The Dmanisi sample, which now comprises five crania, provides direct evidence for wide morphological variation within and among early Homo paleodemes. This implies the existence of a single evolving lineage of early Homo, with phylogeographic continuity across continents.
A Heady Find
In the past two decades, excavations at the archaeological site at Dmanisi, Georgia, have revealed hominin fossils from the earliest Pleistocene, soon after the genus Homo first dispersed beyond Africa. Lordkipanidze et al. (p. 326; see the cover) now describe a fossil cranium from the site. Combined with mandibular remains that had been found earlier, this find completes the first entire hominin skull from this period.},

Species geographic ranges are often viewed as approximately constant in size in geological time, even though climate change studies have shown that historical and modern species geographic distributions are not static. Here, we use an extensive global microfossil database to explore the temporal trajectories of geographic extents over the entire lifespan of marine nannoplankton, diatom, planktic foraminifer and radiolarian species. We show that geographic extents are not static over geological time-scales. Temporal trajectories of species geographic ranges are asymmetric: the rise is quicker than the fall. We propose that once a species has overcome its initial difficulties in geographic establishment, it rises to its peak geographic extent. However, once this peak value is reached, it will also have a maximal number of species to interact with. The negative of these biotic interactions could then cause a gradual geographic decline. We discuss the multiple implications of our findings with reference to macroecological and macroevolutionary studies.},

Our model reproduces several major features of the deglacial climate evolution, suggesting a good agreement in climate sensitivity between the model and observations. In particular, our model simulates the abrupt BA warming as a transient response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to a sudden termination of freshwater discharge to the North Atlantic before the BA. In contrast to previous mechanisms that invoke AMOC multiple equilibrium and Southern Hemisphere climate forcing, we propose that the BA transition is caused by the superposition of climatic responses to the transient CO2 forcing, the AMOC recovery from Heinrich Event 1, and an AMOC overshoot.

We find that feasible sets are dominated by similarly shaped hollow curves, most of which are highly correlated with empirical SADs (most R2 values {\textgreater} 75\%), revealing a strong influence of N and S on the form of the SAD and an a priori explanation for the ubiquitous hollow curve. Empirical SADs are often more hollow and less variable than the majority of the feasible set, revealing exceptional unevenness and relatively low natural variability among ecological communities. We discuss the importance of the feasible set in understanding how general constraints determine observable variation and influence the forms of predicted and empirical patterns.},

	abstract = {Species arise and establish themselves over the geologic time scale. This process is manifested as a change in the relative frequency of occurrences of a given species in the global pool of species. Our main goal here is to model this rise and the eventual decline of microfossil species using a mixed-effects model where groups each have a characteristic occurrence trajectory (main effects) and each species belonging to those groups is allowed to deviate from the given group trajectory (random effects). Our model can be described as a “hat” with logistic forms in the periods of increase and decline. Using the estimated timings of rises and falls, we find that the lengths of the periods of rise are about as long as the lengths of the periods when species are above 50\% of their estimated maximal occurrences. These latter periods are here termed periods of dominance, which are in turn about the same length as the species' periods of fall. The peak rates of the rises of microfossils are in general faster than their peak rates of falls. These quantified observations may have broad macroevolutionary and macroecological implications. Further, we hypothesize that species that have experienced and survived high levels of environmental volatility (specifically, periods of greater than average variation in temperature and productivity) during their formative periods should have longer periods of dominance. This is because subsequent environmental variations should not drive them to decline with ease. We find that higher estimated environmental volatility early in the life of a species positively correlates with lengths of periods of dominance, given that a species survives the initial stress of the environmental fluctuations. However, we find no evidence that the steepness of the rise of a species is affected by environmental volatility in the early phases of its life.},

These estimates can then be used to shed light on questions such as whether extinction and origination rates have been higher or lower at different times in earth history or in different geographical regions, etc. and to investigate the possible underlying causes of varying rates. An inherent problem in inference using occurrence data is one of incompleteness of sampling. Even if a taxon is present at a given time and place, we are guaranteed to detect or sample it less than 100\% of the time we search in a random outcrop or sediment sample that should contain it, either because it was not preserved, it was preserved but then eroded, or because we simply did not find it. Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods rely on replicate sampling to allow for the simultaneous estimation of sampling probability and the parameters of interest (e.g. extinction, origination, occupancy, diversity). Here, we introduce the philosophy of CMR approaches especially as applicable to paleontological data and questions. The use of CMR is in its infancy in paleobiological applications, but the handful of studies that have used it demonstrate its utility and generality. We discuss why the use of CMR has not matched its development in other fields, such as in population ecology, as well as the importance of modelling the sampling process and estimating sampling probabilities. In addition, we suggest some potential avenues for the development of CMR applications in paleobiology.},

Past studies have examined dispersal capabilities, geographic ranges, and single‐character morphological adaptations as factors that may contribute to geologic longevity. Here, I test whether long‐lived fossil crinoid taxa are morphologically unusual using a whole suite of morphological characters. I define long‐lived taxa in several explicit, comparative ways. I find that long‐lived crinoid genera and families are often less distant from mean morphologies of their crinoid orders than their shorter‐lived relatives; that is, they are relatively less specialized. I also compare the morphology of crinoid genera relative to basal members of their respective orders; mean morphological distances of long‐lived genera from basal morphologies are seldom distinct from those of their shorter‐lived relatives. I observe that long‐lived crinoid genera are less distant from mean morphologies of their temporal cohorts compared with shorter‐lived genera but not in a statistically significant manner. I conclude that long‐lived crinoids are relatively unspecialized, in the sense that they are relatively closer to mean morphologies of their taxonomic groups.},

To safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services, designating protected areas is crucial; yet the extent to which the existing placement of protection is aligned to meet these conservation priorities is questionable, especially in the oceans. Here we investigate and compare global patterns of multiple biodiversity components (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional), ecosystem services and human impacts, with the coverage of marine protected areas across a nested spatial scale. We demonstrate a pronounced spatial mismatch between the existing degree of protection and all the conservation priorities above, highlighting that neither the world’s most diverse, nor the most productive ecosystems are currently the most protected ecosystems. Furthermore, we show that global patterns of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human impacts are poorly correlated, hence complicating the identification of generally applicable spatial prioritization schemes. However, a hypothetical “consensus approach” would have been able to address all these conservation priorities far more effectively than the existing degree of protection, which at best is only marginally better than a random expectation. Therefore, a holistic perspective is needed when designating an appropriate degree of protection of marine conservation priorities worldwide.},

In doing so, ecologists have adopted a number of widely different techniques and approaches derived from different schools of thought, and from other scientific disciplines. While the adaptation of a diverse array of statistical approaches and methodologies for the analysis of spatial data has yielded considerable insight into various ecological problems, this diversity of approaches has sometimes impeded communication and retarded more rapid progress in this emergent area. Many of these different statistical methods provide similar information about spatial characteristics, but the differences among these methods make it difficult to compare the results of studies that employ contrasting approaches.

	abstract = {Plant–herbivore interactions occur in all ecosystems and provide a major avenue for energy flow to higher trophic levels. A long-standing hypothesis to explain the latitudinal gradient in species diversity proposes that the relatively stable and frost-free climate of the tropics should lead to more intense biotic interactions in tropical compared with temperate environments, giving rise to a greater diversity of plants and herbivores. Herbivory rates have been compared across latitudes to test this biotic interactions hypothesis, with herbivory typically being measured from observable leaf damage. However, we argue that a measure of percentage leaf damage alone does not straightforwardly reflect the cost of herbivory to the plant, and on its own does not constitute an appropriate test of the biotic interactions hypothesis. For a given amount of herbivory, the impact of herbivory is dependent upon many factors, such as the construction cost of the leaf, the growth and replacement rates and leaf life span. We investigate the latitudinal gradient in herbivory by analysing a large dataset of herbivory rates for 452 tree species and separating the species into those with short and long leaf life spans. We show that annual herbivory rates tend to be greater at lower latitudes for evergreen species (which have long-lived leaves), but no trend in herbivory rate with latitude was found for species with short leaf life spans. Phylogenetic least squares regression assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes also showed a negative effect of latitude on herbivory rate for evergreen trees, but we caution that viewing herbivory as a species trait is problematic. An integrative approach that incorporates leaf life span, as well as the costs of investment in growth and potential costs of losing leaf tissue, is needed to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of herbivory.},

Coupled with this, there has been an increasing interdigitation of paleontology with molecular systematics because of the development of techniques to analyze ancient DNA and because of the use of sophisticated methods to utilize molecules to date evolutionary divergence events. One pervasive pattern emerging from several paleontological and molecular analyses of paleobiogeographic patterns is the recognition that repeated episodes of range expansion or geo-dispersal occur congruently in several different lineages, just as congruent patterns of vicariance also occur in independent lineages. The development of new analytical methods based on a modified version of Brooks Parsimony Analysis makes it possible to analyze both geo-dispersal and vicariance in a phylogenetic context, suggesting that biogeography as a discipline should focus on the analysis of a variety of congruent phenomena, not just vicariance. The important role that extinction plays in influencing apparent biogeographic patterns among modern and fossil groups suggests that this is another area ripe for new methodological developments.},

We present a case study from the fossil record which questions the prominent role of stabilizing selection as a mechanism for stasis. We also discuss an alternative mechanism for stasis based on how species are organized in nature, which predicts that as long as a species occurs in several different environments it will be buffered against net change. We conclude that evolutionary and ecological theory indicate that stabilizing selection will only play an important role in maintaining stasis in species if communities are at equilibrium and/or the physical environment is stable over long periods of time. Currently, most data indicate that neither of these is likely, though the recent documentation of long term stability in the Paleozoic faunas of New York State, the phenomenon of coordinated stasis, could conceivably be correlated with some sort of stable ecological entities, possibly a stable community structure. However, in the case of one of these faunas, the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group, patterns of morphological stasis in species appear to be unrelated to stabilizing selection. This implies either that the stability of the Hamilton Group fauna is not equivalent to a set of stable communities, or, even if it is, then at equilibrium stabilizing selection is not an important mechanism mediating stasis.},

Hominid dietary strategies must be understood within the larger context of carnivore behavior and ecology, as carnivorans could have affected the abilities of hominids to procure meat and/or marrow. The functional anatomy of extant and fossil carnivorans was examined to infer behaviors in fossil carnivorans that would have impacted on hominid dietary strategies in terms of carcass availability. Comparisons of guild structure were carried out to examine changes in carnivoran interactions and their implications for hominid behavior. Plio-Pleistocene carnivorans engaged in a wider range of behaviors than modern carnivorans. The sabertoothed felidsDinofelisandMegantereonprobably did not provide much larger carcasses than modern species. Another sabertooth,Homotheriumgenerated larger carcasses, but may have disarticulated and transported these carcasses. Fossil representatives of modern taxa may not have been equivalent ecologically within the carnivoran guild. Overall, hominids in eastern Africa probably had a greater range of scavenging opportunities than did those of southern Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene. Local and continent-wide extinction events in large-bodied carnivoran guilds from 1 to 2Ma had a substantial effect on carcass availability and the risk to hominid scavengers. These structural changes in the carnivore guild may have provided an opportunity for hominids to widen their niche with respect to dietary behavior.},

We used models to evaluate the hypothesized importance of this trade‐off for explaining coexistence and relative abundance patterns in annual plant assemblages. In a nonspatial model, empirically derived competition‐colonization trade‐offs related to seed mass were insufficient to generate coexistence. This was unchanged by spatial structure or interspecific variation in the fraction of seeds dispersing globally. These results differ from those of the more generalized competition‐colonization models because the latter assume completely asymmetric competition, an assumption that appears unrealistic considering existing data for annual systems. When, for heuristic purposes, completely asymmetric competition was incorporated into our models, unlimited coexistence was possible. However, in the resulting abundance patterns, the best competitors/poorest colonizers were the most abundant, the opposite of that observed in natural systems. By contrast, these natural patterns were produced by competition‐colonization models where environmental heterogeneity permitted species coexistence. Thus, despite the failure of the simple competition‐colonization trade‐off to explain coexistence in annual plant systems, this trade‐off may be essential to explaining relative abundance patterns when other processes permit coexistence.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Ecosystems are prototypical examples of complex adaptive systems, in which patterns at higher levels emerge from localized interactions and selection processes acting at lower levels. An essential aspect of such systems is nonlinearity, leading to historical dependency and multiple possible outcomes of dynamics. Given this, it is essential to determine the degree to which system features are determined by environmental conditions, and the degree to which they are the result of self-organization. Furthermore, given the multiple levels at which dynamics become apparent and at which selection can act, central issues relate to how evolution shapes ecosystems properties, and whether ecosystems become buffered to changes (more resilient) over their ecological and evolutionary development or proceed to critical states and the edge of chaos.},

While I sympathize with the frustrating problem of small sample size in hominid finds, one must ask the question: could you ever see a trend, given the quality of your information? If sample size is low, if trends are of relatively small magnitude, and if sample variance is high, one can always safely show that nothing (i.e., stasis) has happened. This form of inference falls into a classic statistical trap: attempting to prove statistical homogeneity. You cannot do it without a concomitant estimate of least significant difference, that is, estimating the magnitude of variation within which you cannot distinguish among estimates of a parameter.},

	abstract = {This paper uses changes in origination and extinction rates and species richness of eastern African carnivorans through time to discuss issues related to the evolution of hominin behavior. To address the question of which taxa were most likely to have had competitive interactions with hominins, modern carnivorans were sorted into size classes based on shifts in behavior, ecology, and body mass. Four size classes were created, among which the two largest (21.5–100 kg and {\textgreater}100 kg) include those taxa whose behavior is most relevant to the evolution of hominin dietary behavior. Fossil taxa were then assigned to these size classes. A summary of the temporal range and reconstructed behavior and ecology of fossil members of the two largest size classes is presented. We discuss the relevance of each taxon to reconstructing hominin behavior and suggest that hominins must have evolved not only successful anti-predator strategies, but also successful strategies to avoid kleptoparasitism before carcass-based resources could become an important part of the diet. Although hominins were unlikely to have been top predators upon first entrance into the carnivore guild, effective anti-predator/anti-kleptoparasitism strategies in combination with the eventual evolution of active hunting would have increased the rank of hominin species within the guild. While the appearance of stone tools at 2.6 Ma has no apparent effect upon carnivorans, the appearance of Homo ergaster after 1.8 Ma may have been at least partly responsible for the decrease in the carnivoran origination rate and the increase in the extinction rate at this time. The behavior of H. ergaster, climate change, and concomitant changes in prey species richness may have caused carnivoran species richness to drop precipitously after 1.5 Ma. In this situation, even effective kleptoparasitism by H. ergaster may have been enough to drive local populations of carnivorans that overlapped with hominins in dietary resources to extinction. Possibly as a result, the modern guild, which evolved within the last few hundred thousand years, is composed primarily of generalists. Although the impact of H. sapiens on the carnivoran guild cannot be assessed due to a lack of carnivoran fossils from this time period, one might not consider the modern carnivore guild to be complete until the appearance of our species approximately 200,000 years ago.},

The enrichment between tooth enamel δ18O values of ES and EI animals records the degree of 18O enrichment between evaporated water (ingested water or body water) and source water, which increases with environmental aridity.

In other words, micro- and macroevolutionary patterns show fundamental similarities and therefore are most simply explained as being caused by the same kinds of evolutionary forces. I begin by examining the evolution of single lineages and argue that dynamics of adaptive evolution are the same for bacteria in test-tube evolution experiments and fossil lineages. Similarly, I argue that the essential features of adaptive radiations large and small can be attributed to conventional forces such as mutation and diversifying natural selection due to competition. I then address recent claims that the molecular features of metazoan development are the result of clade-level selection for evolvability, and suggest that these features can be more easily explained by conventional individual-level selection for the suppression of deleterious pleiotropic effects. Finally, I ask what must be known if we are to understand the ultimate causes of molecular and developmental diversity.},

	abstract = {1.Successional gradients are ubiquitous in nature, yet few studies have systematically examined the evolutionary origins of taxa that specialize at different successional stages. Here we quantify successional habitat specialization in Neotropical forest trees and evaluate its evolutionary lability along a precipitation gradient. Theoretically, successional habitat specialization should be more evolutionarily conserved in wet forests than in dry forests due to more extreme microenvironmental differentiation between early and late successional stages in wet forest. 2.We applied a robust multinomial classification model to samples of primary and secondary forest trees from 14 Neotropical lowland forest sites spanning a precipitation gradient from 788 to 4000 mm annual rainfall, identifying species that are old growth specialists and secondary forest specialists in each site. We constructed phylogenies for the classified taxa at each site and for the entire set of classified taxa, and tested whether successional habitat specialization is phylogenetically conserved. We further investigated differences in the functional traits of species specializing in secondary vs. old-growth forest along the precipitation gradient, expecting different trait associations with secondary forest specialists in wet vs. dry forests since water availability is more limiting in dry forests and light availability more limiting in wet forests. 3.Successional habitat specialization is non-randomly distributed in the angiosperm phylogeny, with a tendency towards phylogenetic conservatism overall and a trend toward stronger conservatism in wet forests than in dry forests. However, the specialists come from all the major branches of the angiosperm phylogeny, and very few functional traits showed any consistent relationships with successional habitat specialization in either wet or dry forests. 4.Synthesis: The niche conservatism evident in the habitat specialization of Neotropical trees suggests a role for radiation into different successional habitats in the evolution of species-rich genera, though the diversity of functional traits that lead to success in different successional habitats complicates analyses at the community scale. Examining the distribution of particular lineages with respect to successional gradients may provide more insight into the role of successional habitat specialization in the evolution of species-rich taxa.

Regression estimates of rates of evolution in cranial capacity are also obtained. A non-parametric test for trend suggests that cranial capacity in both H. erectus and early H. sapiens may increase significantly through time. Cranial capacity in an Asian subsample of H. erectus (comprised of Chinese and Indonesian specimens) increases significantly through time. Other sub-samples of H. erectus (African, Chinese, and Indonesian) do not appear to increase significantly through time. Regression results generally corroborate results of the test for trend. Spatial and temporal variation may characterize evolution of cranial capacity in H. erectus. Different patterns of cranial capacity evolution may distinguish H. erectus from early H. sapiens.},

Using southern African and British bird richness patterns, we show here that commoner species are most responsible for richness patterns. While rare and common species show markedly different species richness patterns, most spatial patterning in richness is caused by relatively few, more common, species.

	abstract = {We investigated relationships between richness patterns of rare and common grassland species and environmental factors, focussing on comparing the degree to which the richness patterns of rare and common species are determined by simple environmental variables. Using data collected in the Machair grassland of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, we fitted spatial regression models using a suite of grazing, soil physicochemical and microtopographic covariates, to nested sub-assemblages of vascular and non-vascular species ranked according to rarity. As expected, we found that common species drive richness patterns, but rare vascular species had significantly stronger affinity for high richness areas. After correcting for the prevalence of individual species distributions, we found differences between common and rare species in 1) the amount of variation explained: richness patterns of common species were better summarised by simple environmental variables, 2) the associations of environmental variables with richness showed systematic trends between common and rare species with coefficient sign reversal for several factors, and 3) richness associations with rare environments: richness patterns of rare vascular species significantly matched rare environments but those of non-vascular species did not. Richness patterns of rare species, at least in this system, may be intrinsically less predictable than those of common species.},

	abstract = {A problematic magnetostratigraphy for the Koobi Fora Formation has contributed to debates on the evolutionary implications for early hominin fossils. To address this, 50 independent samples distributed over a nearly 63-m-thick interval were collected from the lower-middle KBS Member type section in fossil collection Area 102, northeast Turkana Basin. Characteristic directions obtained by thermal demagnetization define a coherent magnetostratigraphy that is supported by alternating-field studies on 28 sister specimens and the prior tephrochronological framework. Two long polarity intervals were recognized, each 30–40 m in thickness, and interpreted as the upper part of the normal polarity Olduvai Subchron and the overlying reverse polarity Matuyama Chron. The end Olduvai consists of a normal–reverse–normal polarity sequence occurring over a thickness of at least 1 m but perhaps up to 5 m, suggesting that this subchron has a short reverse interval in its uppermost part. Such a fine-scale structure also has been reported from several other sites, like the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary and point stratotype section at Vrica, Italy, which serves as a basis for formally delimiting three temporally discrete polarity subintervals for the Olduvai Subchron. These paleomagnetic results that place the upper boundary of the Olduvai at ∼ 48 m above the base of the KBS Member, coupled with published radioisotopic dates, firmly secure the age of partial cranium KNM-ER 3733 in the interval 1.78–1.48 Ma, with an interpolated age of ∼ 1.7 Ma, giving this fossil the most unambiguous numerical-age constraints, as compared to the oldest Homo cranial remains from Europe and Asia. Nonetheless, assured placement of the top of the Olduvai Subchron in the KBS Member is not sufficient in the face of other uncertainties to influence conventional interpretations of the timing and direction for the global dispersal of early Homo erectus.},

	abstract = {SummarySix islands, each less than a hectare in area, were isolated in about 1913 from the mainland of central Panamá by the rising waters of Gatun Lake. By 1980, the diversity of trees on all but one of these islands was far lower than on mainland plots of comparable size. A restricted subset of tree species has spread on these islands, notablyProtium panamense, Scheelea zonensis, Oenocarpus panamanus andSwartzia simplex. We constructed a null model to predict how chance would change tree diversity and the similarity of tree species compositions of different islands, assuming that each mature tree has equal chances of dying and/or reproducing, regardless of its species. This model cannot account for the diminished diversity of the changes in vegetation on these islands: some factors must be favoring a particular set of tree species.Two factors, exposure to wind and absence of mammals, seem needed to bring about the vegetation changes observed on these small islands. Their vegetation shows many signs of wind damage and of adaptation to resist wind, reflecting its exposure to dry season winds and storm winds sweeping across the lake from the west. Their most common tree species appear to have spread because mammals rarely visit these small and isolated islands. Seed of these common species are normally much eaten by mammals and do not need burial by mammals to escape insect attack.A thorough grasp of plant—animal interactions is needed to understand the events that have taken place on these islands. Identifying those ‘keystone animals’ essential for maintaining plant diversity is a necessary element of reserve design and forest management in the tropics.},

	abstract = {Metacommunity ecology links smaller-scale processes that have been the provenance of population and community ecology―such as birth-death processes, species interactions, selection, and stochasticity―with larger-scale issues such as dispersal and habitat heterogeneity. Until now, the field has focused on evaluating the relative importance of distinct processes, with niche-based environmental sorting on one side and neutral-based ecological drift and dispersal limitation on the other. This book moves beyond these artificial categorizations, showing how environmental sorting, dispersal, ecological drift, and other processes influence metacommunity structure simultaneously.Mathew Leibold and Jonathan Chase argue that the relative importance of these processes depends on the characteristics of the organisms, the strengths and types of their interactions, the degree of habitat heterogeneity, the rates of dispersal, and the scale at which the system is observed. Using this synthetic perspective, they explore metacommunity patterns in time and space, including patterns of coexistence, distribution, and diversity. Leibold and Chase demonstrate how these processes and patterns are altered by micro- and macroevolution, traits and phylogenetic relationships, and food web interactions. They then use this scale-explicit perspective to illustrate how metacommunity processes are essential for understanding macroecological and biogeographical patterns as well as ecosystem-level processes.Moving seamlessly across scales and subdisciplines, Metacommunity Ecology is an invaluable reference, one that offers a more integrated approach to ecological patterns and processes.},

It has been hypothesized that joint associations of community composition with environment and space could be due to patch dynamics involving colonization-extinction processes in environmentally heterogeneous landscapes but this has yet to be theoretically shown.  We develop a two-patch type-two species competition model in such a 'harlequin' landscape (where different patches have different environments) to evaluate how composition is related to environmental and spatial effects as a function of background extinction rate.  Using spatially implicit analytical models, we find that the environmental association of community composition declines with extinction rate as expected.  Using spatially explicit simulation models, we further find that there is an increase in the spatial structure with extinction due to spatial patterning into clusters that are not related to environmental conditions but that this increase is limited.  Natural metacommunities often show both environment and spatial determination even under conditions of relatively high isolation and these could be more easily explained by our model than alternative metacommunity models.},

In the Koro Toro fossiliferous area, KT 12 locality (16°00′N, 18°53′E) was the site of discovery of Australopithecus bahrelghazali (Abel) and in the Toros-Menalla fossiliferous area, TM 266 locality (16°15′N, 17°29′E) was the site of discovery of Sahelanthropus tchadensis (Toumaï). At both localities, the evolutive degree of the associated fossil mammal assemblages allowed a biochronological estimation of the hominid remains: early Pliocene (3–3.5 Ma) at KT 12 and late Miocene (≈7 Ma) at TM 266. Atmospheric 10Be, a cosmogenic nuclide, was used to quasicontinuously date these sedimentary units. The authigenic 10Be/9Be dating of a pelite relic within the sedimentary level containing Abel yields an age of 3.58 ± 0.27 Ma that points to the contemporaneity of Australopithecus bahrelghazali (Abel) with Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy). The 28 10Be/9Be ages obtained within the anthracotheriid unit containing Toumaï bracket, by absolute dating, the age of Sahelanthropus tchadensis to lie between 6.8 and 7.2 Ma. This chronological constraint is an important cornerstone both for establishing the earliest stages of hominid evolution and for new calibrations of the molecular clock.},

	abstract = {Scale is widely recognized as a fundamental conceptual problem in biology, but the question of whether species-richness patterns vary with scale is often ignored in macro-ecological analyses, despite the increasing application of such data in international conservation programmes. We tested for scaling effects in species-richness gradients with spatially scaled data for 241 species of South American hummingbirds (Trochilidae). Analyses revealed that scale matters above and beyond the effect of quadrat area. Species richness was positively correlated with latitude and topographical relief at ten different spatial scales spanning two orders of magnitude (ca. 12,300 to ca. 1,225,000 km2). Surprisingly, when the influence of topography was removed, the conditional variation in species richness explained by latitude fell precipitously to insignificance at coarser spatial scales. The perception of macro-ecological pattern thus depends directly upon the scale of analysis. Although our results suggest there is no single correct scale for macro-ecological analyses, the averaging effect of quadrat sampling at coarser geographical scales obscures the fine structure of species-richness gradients and localized richness peaks, decreasing the power of statistical tests to discriminate the causal agents of regional richness gradients. Ideally, the scale of analysis should be varied systematically to provide the optimal resolution of macro-ecological pattern.},

Because extinction leaves a characteristic signature in the shape of molecular phylogenetic trees, many studies have used data from extant taxa only to infer extinction rates. This is a promising approach for the large number of taxa for which extinction rates cannot be estimated from the fossil record. Here, I explore the consequences of violating a common assumption made by studies of extinction from phylogenetic data. I show that when diversification rates vary among lineages, simple estimators based on the birth-death process are unable to recover true extinction rates. This is problematic for phylogenetic trees with complete taxon sampling as well as for the simpler case of clades with known age and species richness. Given the ubiquity of variation in diversification rates among lineages and clades, these results suggest that extinction rates should not be estimated in the absence of fossil data.},

	abstract = {Theories of causality in ecology and evolution rarely lend themselves to analysis by the formal method of "hypothesis testing" envisioned by champions of a "strong inference" model of scientific method. The objective of biological research typically is to assess the relative contributions of a number of potential causal agents operating simultaneously. Sensibly stated hypotheses in the methodology of most field investigations are similar to hypotheses of applied statistics. They are not intended to be mutually exclusive, in any sense exhaustive, or global in their application. It is not possible in principle to perform a "critical test" or experiment to distinguish between the truth of "alternative hypotheses" if the proposed causal processes they caricature occur simultaneously. We consider several examples in which a rigid hypothetico-deductive methodology applied to nonalternative ecological "hypotheses" could lead to fallacious conclusions. It has been proposed that processes of ecological succession may be separated into alternative modes of "facilitation," "inhibition," and "tolerance." Yet attempts to experimentally reject one or more of the supposedly distinct hypotheses cannot, in principle, distinguish between them in a variety of biologically interesting cases. In studies of the limits of distributions of intertidal organisms, reasonable univariate experimental tests of possible causes would lead to rejection of "biological enemy" hypotheses when a "keystone predator effect" occurs because the interaction between competition and predation reverses the direction of the effect on some prey populations expected from either process in isolation. Particular problems arise when "null models" in ecology are treated as hypotheses of "strong inference." Models of ecological or evolutionary causality rarely have single or easily stated "null" converses. Tractable null models have no probability of being strictly true, and thus may be rejected a priori as hypothetico-deductive constructs. In practice, their role is as a reference point for measurement of departures. Their usefulness in this regard depends upon the reliability with which the characteristics of biology without interaction can be estimated. Applied to studies of interspecific competition through the use of species distributions, purported null hypotheses make different biological assumptions than those of the interactive models. They seem neither especially more reliable nor in any way more fundamental. We see no reason to accept the recent claims that "null hypotheses," as applied in ecology and evolution, have any logical primacy or greater parsimony than other approaches to partitioning the variation observed in natural communities among the contributions of many observable causes. Careful consideration of possible explanations and controlled experimentation contribute a great deal to ecological and evolutionary knowledge. However, we believe that the hypothetico-deductive model of scientific method can provide misleading prescriptions for efficient investigation and acceptance of evidence in phenomena with multiple causes, and should be applied with appropriate skepticism.},

	abstract = {Aim  Climate is recognized for the significant role it plays in the global distribution of plant species diversity. We test the extent to which two aspects of climate, namely temperature and precipitation, explain the spatial distribution of high taxonomic groupings (plant families) at a regional spatial resolution (the Neotropics). Our goal is to provide a quantitative and comparative framework for identifying the local effects of climate on the familial composition of tropical forests by identifying the influence of climate on the number of individuals and the number of species within a given family. Location  One hundred and forty-four 0.1-ha forest transect sites from the Neotropics (19.8°N–27.0°S and 40.1°W–105.1°W). Data were originally collected by A.H. Gentry. Methods  Spatial variability in the abundance (density) and species richness of 159 tropical plant families across a range of predominately lowland Neotropical landscapes were attributed to eight temperature and precipitation measures using the eigen analysis method of two-field joint single-value decomposition. Results  Climate significantly affects the within-clade diversity of several ecologically important Neotropical plant families. Intrafamily abundance and richness covary with temperature in some families (e.g. Fabaceae) and with precipitation in others (e.g. Bignoniaceae, Arecaceae), with differing climatic preferences observed even among co-occurring families. In addition, the family-level composition of Neotropical forests, in both abundance and richness, appears to be influenced more by temperature than by precipitation. Among lowland families, only Asteraceae increased in species richness with decreasing temperature, although several families, including Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae, are more abundant at lower temperatures. Main conclusions  Although plant diversity is known to vary as a function of climate at the species level, we document clear climatic preferences even at the rank of family. Temperature plays a stronger role in governing the familial composition of tropical forests, particularly in the richness of families, than might be expected given its narrow annual and diurnal range in the tropics. Although other environmental or geographic variables that covary with temperature may be more causally linked to diversity differences than temperature itself, the results nonetheless identify the taxonomic components of tropical forest composition that may be most affected by future climatic changes.},

Predicting those effects is an enduring challenge to the field of ecology. Using a simple laboratory system, Hoek and colleagues present evidence that resource availability can be a primary driver of variation between interactions. Their results suggest that a complex continuum of interaction outcomes can result from the simple combined effects of nutrient availability and density-dependent population dynamics. The future is rich with potential to integrate tractable experimental systems like theirs with hypotheses derived from studies of interactions in natural communities.},

	abstract = {A combination of abiotic and biotic factors probably restricts the range of many species. Recent evolutionary models and tests of those models have asked how a gradual change in environmental conditions can set the range limit, with a prominent idea being that gene flow disrupts local adaptation. We investigate how biotic factors, explicitly competition for limited resources, result in evolutionarily stable range limits even in the absence of the disruptive effect of gene flow. We model two competing species occupying different segments of the resource spectrum. If one segment of the resource spectrum declines across space, a species that specializes on that segment can be driven to extinction, even though in the absence of competition it would evolve to exploit other abundant resources and so be saved. The result is that a species range limit is set in both evolutionary and ecological time, as the resources associated with its niche decline. Factors promoting this outcome include: (i) inherent gaps in the resource distribution, (ii) relatively high fitness of the species when in its own niche, and low fitness in the alternative niche, even when resource abundances are similar in each niche, (iii) strong interspecific competition, and (iv) asymmetric interspecific competition. We suggest that these features are likely to be common in multispecies communities, thereby setting evolutionarily stable range limits.},

Of the 177 species of mammals from the upper Eocene-lower Oligocene (37-30 Ma) White River Group in the High Plains, most species are static for 2.4 million years on average, and some persist much longer. Only three examples of gradualism can be documented in the entire fauna, and these are mostly size changes. Contrary to expectations, most mammalian species show no change during the earliest Oligocene climatic crash (33.2 Ma), in spite of the fact that the vegetation changed from dense forests to open forested grassland, mean annual temperatures dropped 13°C, and conditions got much drier and more seasonal. Only a few mammalian lineages speciated, a few more went extinct, and the vast majority (62 out of 70) persisted through this climatic event with no observable response whatsoever. This evidence shows that organisms are much less responsive to the environment than short-term neontological studies suggest.},

	abstract = {The development of the East African Rift System (EARS) caused by tectonic forcing during the past 20 million years is believed to influence the regional climate in Africa. However, changes in the Earth's orbital parameters also have an influence on climate on these timescales. To analyze the influence of both tectonic and orbital forcing, we applied the non-hydrostatic regional climate model COSMO-CLM (COSMO model in Climate Mode, CCLM). The regional simulations are driven by different global simulations performed with the coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation model ECHO-G. To analyze the impact of tectonic forcing a different topography representing a possible past stage of the development of the EARS is applied in the model. The results indicate that tectonic forcing has a strong impact on precipitation in Africa caused by circulation changes. To analyze the impact of orbital forcing, which means the impact of changing insolation patterns, we chose configurations of the Earth's orbit that result in significantly different patterns of insolation. One example is the orbital configuration of the last interglacial at 125,000 years before present, when the seasonality of insolation in the Northern Hemisphere was greatly enhanced, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere it was substantially weakened compared to preindustrial conditions. The simulation of this time slice shows a strong impact of orbital forcing on precipitation in large parts of Africa, caused by altered moisture transport. The application of a biome model helps in analyzing the impact of the two forcing factors on vegetation for a more direct comparison with proxy data.},

Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome to study its evolutionary relationship with the chimpanzee and human genomes. We find that more than three per cent of the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo or the chimpanzee genome than these are to each other. These regions allow various aspects of the ancestry of the two ape species to be reconstructed. In addition, many of the regions that overlap genes may eventually help us understand the genetic basis of phenotypes that humans share with one of the two apes to the exclusion of the other.},

The relative small size of the crown, its marked MD elongation and BL reduction, the relative position of the cusps, the lack of a C6 and the mild expression of a protostylid, reinforced by metrical analyses, demonstrate the distinctiveness of this tooth compared with Australopithecus afarensis, A. anamensis, A. africanus and Paranthropus boisei, and its similarity to early Homo. The LA1α site lies 2.2m above the Ekalalei Tuff which is slightly younger than Tuff F dated to 2.34±0.04Myr.

Pollen data are valuable as a record of the response of ecosystems to human impacts in history and prehistory, as a rich source of information about natural vegetation dynamics, and as the only empirical evidence for the behaviour of plant taxa and assemblages when subjected to major climatic and environmental changes. Many studies of contemporary (surface) pollen deposition have shown that pollen assemblages are diagnostic for broadly defined vegetation types such as formations or forest-types. Other surface pollen studies have established that there is a quantitative relationship between the pollen percentages of the major taxa and their relative importance in the vegetation. Maps based on surface pollen data reflect patterns of species abundance over a range of spatial scales (Fig. 1). Pollen diagrams can therefore be assumed to reflect vegetation change, and maps based on adequately time-correlated fossil pollen assemblages can be assumed to reflect vegetational patterns that existed in the past — allowing vegetation to be mapped in time and space.},

We reconcile the discrepancy in diversity loss from invaders by showing that invaded communities have lower local richness but steeper species accumulation with area than that of uninvaded communities, leading to proportionately fewer species loss at broader spatial scales. We show that invaders drive scale-dependent biodiversity loss through strong neutral sampling effects on the number of individuals in a community. We also show that nonneutral species extirpations are due to a proportionately larger effect of invaders on common species, suggesting that rare species are buffered against extinction. Our study provides a synthetic perspective on the threat of invasions to biodiversity loss across spatial scales.
In three different biomes, invasive plant species cause larger declines in common species than in rare species.

We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species.

J Hum Evol 51: 207–212]. How the required extra amount of human brain growth is achieved and what its implications are for human life history and cognitive development are still a matter of debate. Likewise, because comparative fossil evidence is scarce, when and how the modern human pattern of brain growth arose during evolution is largely unknown. Virtual reconstructions of a Neanderthal neonate from Mezmaiskaya Cave (Russia) and of two Neanderthal infant skeletons from Dederiyeh Cave (Syria) now provide new comparative insights: Neanderthal brain size at birth was similar to that in recent Homo sapiens and most likely subject to similar obstetric constraints. Neanderthal brain growth rates during early infancy were higher, however. This pattern of growth resulted in larger adult brain sizes but not in earlier completion of brain growth. Because large brains growing at high rates require large, late-maturing, mothers [Leigh SR and Blomquist GE (2007) in Campbell CJ et al. Primates in perspective; pp 396–407], it is likely that Neanderthal life history was similarly slow, or even slower-paced, than in recent H. sapiens.},

This suite of derived traits suggests major changes in energy expenditure and allocation in the human lineage, but direct measures of human and ape metabolism are needed to compare evolved energy strategies among hominoids. Here we used doubly labelled water measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE; kcal day−1) in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans to test the hypothesis that the human lineage has experienced an acceleration in metabolic rate, providing energy for larger brains and faster reproduction without sacrificing maintenance and longevity. In multivariate regressions including body size and physical activity, human TEE exceeded that of chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas and orangutans by approximately 400, 635 and 820 kcal day−1, respectively, readily accommodating the cost of humans’ greater brain size and reproductive output. Much of the increase in TEE is attributable to humans’ greater basal metabolic rate (kcal day−1), indicating increased organ metabolic activity. Humans also had the greatest body fat percentage. An increased metabolic rate, along with changes in energy allocation, was crucial in the evolution of human brain size and life history.},

	abstract = {Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer–algae chemostats; alewife–zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife–zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

Despite the complexity and diversity of different ecosystems, there exists a surprisingly simple, approximate answer: the number of species is proportional to the size of the area raised to some exponent. The exponent often turns out to be roughly 1/4. This power law can be derived from assumptions about the relative abundances of species or from notions of self-similarity. Here we analyze the largest existing data set of location-mapped species: over one million, individually identified trees from five tropical forests on three continents. Although the power law is a reasonable, zeroth-order approximation of our data, we find consistent deviations from it on all spatial scales. Furthermore, tropical forests are not self-similar at areas ≤50 hectares. We develop an extended model of the species-area relationship, which enables us to predict large-scale species diversity from small-scale data samples more accurately than any other available method.},

	abstract = {Barranc de la Boella is made up of several open-air late Early Pleistocene archaeological sites (Pit 1, La Mina and El Forn) the formation of which is related to a deltaic sedimentary environment. Its age makes it a key site for studying the behavior of the early hominin groups of the Iberian Peninsula and western Europe and the ecological context in which they developed.

At La Mina locality, three archaeostratigraphic levels have been identified, with level 2 being the richest in terms of the archaeological remains recovered. It exhibits high taxonomic diversity, with the most common taxa belonging to open and partially open habitats, although aquatic and riparian taxa have also been identified. Carnivore remains are present, although scarce. Coprolites from a hyaenid have also been found.

Both hominin and carnivore activity has been documented at the site. Evidence of carnivore activity suggests at least one bone-cracking carnivore had access to the assemblage. The anatomical ratios employed suggest that La Mina was formed at a time of high competition (intra and/or inter-specific), with a high number of predators in this ecological context. Anthropic activity in a highly competitive context might suggest that these hominin groups had a high degree of control over the environment and over local resources, as has been shown at other Early Pleistocene sites.},

	abstract = {The Cradle of Humankind (Cradle) in South Africa preserves a rich collection of fossil hominins representing Australopithecus, Paranthropus and Homo1. The ages of these fossils are contentious2-4 and have compromised the degree to which the South African hominin record can be used to test hypotheses of human evolution. However, uranium-lead (U-Pb) analyses of horizontally bedded layers of calcium carbonate (flowstone) provide a potential opportunity to obtain a robust chronology5. Flowstones are ubiquitous cave features and provide a palaeoclimatic context, because they grow only during phases of increased effective precipitation6,7, ideally in closed caves. Here we show that flowstones from eight Cradle caves date to six narrow time intervals between 3.2 and 1.3 million years ago. We use a kernel density estimate to combine 29 U-Pb ages into a single record of flowstone growth intervals. We interpret these as major wet phases, when an increased water supply, more extensive vegetation cover and at least partially closed caves allowed for undisturbed, semi-continuous growth of the flowstones. The intervening times represent substantially drier phases, during which fossils of hominins and other fossils accumulated in open caves. Fossil preservation, restricted to drier intervals, thus biases the view of hominin evolutionary history and behaviour, and places the hominins in a community of comparatively dry-adapted fauna. Although the periods of cave closure leave temporal gaps in the South African fossil record, the flowstones themselves provide valuable insights into both local and pan-African climate variability.},

The diversity of small collections, all of whose members can be identified and counted, is defined by Brillouin's measure of information. With larger collections it becomes necessary to estimate diversity; what is estimated is Shannon's measure of information which is a function of the population proportions of the several species. Different methods of estimation are appropriate for different types of collections. If the collection can be randomly sampled and the total number of species is known, Basharin's formula may be used. With a random sample from a population containing an unknown number of species, Good's method is sometimes applicable. With a patchy population of sessile organisms, such as a plant community, random samples are unobtainable since the contents of a randomly placed quadrat are not a random sample of the parent population. To estimate the diversity of such a community a method is proposed whereby the sample size is progressively increased by addition of new quadrats; as this is done the diversity of the pooled sample increases and then levels off. The mean increment in total diversity that results from enlarging the sample still more then provides an estimate of the diversity per individual in the whole population.},

	abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in metapopulation dynamics as it conditions species' spatial responses to gradients of abiotic and biotic conditions and triggers individual and gene flows. In the numerous plants that are dispersed through seed consumption by herbivores (endozoochory), the distance and effectiveness of dispersal is determined by the combined effects of seed retention time in the vector's digestive system, the spatial extent of its movements, and the ability of the seeds to germinate once released. Estimating these three parameters from experimental data is therefore crucial to calibrate mechanistic metacommunity models of plant–herbivore interactions. In this study, we jointly estimated the retention time and germination probability of six herbaceous plants transported by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) through feeding experiments and a Bayesian dynamic model. Retention time was longer in the nonruminant wild boar ({\textgreater}36 h) than in the two ruminant species (roe deer: 18–36 h, red deer: 3–36 h). In the two ruminants, but not in wild boar, small and round seeds were excreted faster than large ones. Low germination probabilities of the excreted seeds reflected the high cost imposed by endozoochory on plant survival. Trait-mediated variations in retention time and germination probability among animal and plant species may impact plant dispersal distances and interact with biotic and abiotic conditions at the release site to shape the spatial patterns of dispersed plant species.},

These observations, in addition to other taphonomic data, suggest that the remains of many animals recovered in Member 2 are from individuals that entered the cave on their own—whether accidentally by falling through avens connecting the cave to the ground surface above or by intentional entry—and were then unable to escape, rather than primarily through systematic collection by a biotic, bone-accumulating agent. The taphonomic conclusion that animals with climbing proclivities (i.e., primates and carnivores) are preferentially preserved over other taxa, ultimately because of those proclivities, urges caution in assessing the fidelity of the assemblage for reconstruction of the Member 2 paleoenvironment. With that caveat, we infer that the Member 2 paleoenvironment was typified by rolling, rock-littered and brush- and scrub-covered hills, indicated by the abundant F. caracal and cercopithecoid fossils recovered and the identified presence of the extinct Caprinae Makapania broomi. In addition, the valley bottom may have retained standing water year-round, perhaps supporting some tree cover—a setting suitable for the well-represented ambush predator P. pardus and suggested by the presence of Alcelaphini. Finally, the reconstructed taphonomic and paleoenvironmental settings of Sterkfontein Member 2 are compared to penecontemporaneous sites in South and East Africa.},

	abstract = {Sterkfontein Caves is the single richest early hominin site in the world with deposits yielding one or more species of Australopithecus and possible early Homo, as well as an extensive faunal collection. The inability to date the southern African cave sites accurately or precisely has hindered attempts to integrate the hominin fossil evidence into pan-African scenarios about human evolutionary history, and especially hominin biogeography. We have used U-Pb and U-Th techniques to date sheets of calcium carbonate flowstone inter-bedded between the fossiliferous sediments. For the first time, absolute age ranges can be assigned to the fossil-bearing deposits: Member 2 is between 2.8 ± 0.28 and 2.6 ± 0.30 Ma and Member 4 between 2.65 ± 0.30 and 2.01 ± 0.05 Ma. The age of 2.01 ± 0.05 Ma for the top of Member 4 constrains the last appearance of Australopithecus africanus to 2 Ma. In the Silberberg Grotto we have reproduced the U-Pb age of ∼2.2 Ma of for the flowstones associated with StW573. We believe that these deposits, including the fossil and the flowstones, accumulated rapidly around 2.2 Ma. The stratigraphy of the site is complex as sediments are exposed both in the underground chambers and at surface. We present a new interpretation of the stratigraphy based on surface mapping, boreholes logs and U-Pb ages. Every effort was made to retain the Member system, however, only Members 2 and 4 are recognized in the boreholes. We propose that the deposits formally known as Member 3 are in fact the distal equivalents of Member 4. The sediments of Members 2 and 4 consisted of cone-like deposits and probably never filled up the cave. The U-Th ages show that there are substantial deposits younger than 400 ka in the underground cave, underlying the older deposits, highlighting again that these cave fills are not simple layer-cakes.},

Disturbance by ice scour opens patches for development of alternative states, and in winter 1996-97, 60 experimental clearings of differing sizes were established on Swan's Island, ME, US.  Half of the plots were re-cleared during the winter of 2010-11.  Recruitment data for barnacles, mussels and fucoid algae collected from 1997 to 2012 were used to (1) test for persistence of scale-dependent thresholds, (2) estimate the magnitudes and sources of variation, (3) fit a surface of alternative states as defined by the cusp catastrophe, and (4) test if 1997 recruitment would predict 2010-11 recruitment in re-scraped plots (i.e. a test of divergence, which is expected in systems with alternative states). For barnacles and mussels, recruitment varied enormously year-to-year and among sites, but showed consistent patterns over the long-term with respect to clearing size. Average recruitment prior to re-clearing was a good predictor of recruitment afterwards. In contrast, over 50\% of the variance in fucoid recruitment was unexplained with weak effects among years and locations. Past fucoid recruitment was a poor predictor of subsequent recruitment. The cusp analysis indicated that fucoid recruitment defines the alternative states.  Fucoid recruitment was largely unpredictable and suggests long-term, small-scale priority effects drive the development of alternative states.  These observations strongly reinforce the notion that long-term and well-replicated experiments are necessary to develop robust tests of ecological theory.},

Recursion equations are derived for both the allele frequency and the mean of the quantitative character. It is shown that the dynamics of the quantitative trait fit a "punctuated equilibrium" pattern of evolution.

We present analyses of a dataset of 286 estimates of home range overlap from 100 primate species, with comparable samples for other space-use traits. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first multispecies study using overlap data estimated directly from field observations. We find that space-use traits in primates are only weakly related to body mass, reflecting their largely arboreal habits. Our results confirm a theory that home range overlap explains the differences in allometric scaling between population density and home range size. We then test a suite of hypotheses to explain home range overlap, both among and within species. We find that overlap is highest for larger-bodied species living in large home ranges at high population densities, where annual rainfall is low, and is higher for arboreal than terrestrial species. Most of these results are consistent with the economics of resource defence, although the predictions of one specific theory of home range overlap are not supported. We conclude that home range overlap is somewhat predictable, but the theoretical basis of animal space use remains patchy.},

A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

Breeding population sizes exhibited no overall trend in three species and increased in the fourth. Recent droughts account satisfactorily for an increase in recruitment failures. These data illustrate that to distinguish between natural population fluctuations and declines with anthropogenic causes may require long-term studies.},

Each of these factors may change through geological time because each is a function of animal ecology and physiology. Animal ecology and physiology, in turn, are products of interacting evolutionary and environmental factors. The direction of change in animal biomass through time may be predicted given knowledge of environmental and ecological change. At a finer level, physiological differences among phyla or other higher taxa suggest that they would have had differential responses to specific environmental changes. Physiological features shared by all of life, such as the dependence of metabolic rate on ambient temperature, suggest that even a coarse time-series of relative changes in animal biomass may enrich understanding of biogeochemical cycling among all organisms, including phytoplankton and microbes. Changes in the abundance of skeletal material in shallow marine deposits through geological time indicate that the biomass of benthic skeletal invertebrates has fluctuated significantly on timescales from millions to hundreds of millions of years. During the Ordovician radiation, increase in the complexity of animal food webs and increase in the efficiency of animal communities in removing available food from the water column and sediment appear most likely to account for a secular increase in animal biomass. Decrease in animal biomass after the end-Permian extinction appears to have been driven by a combination of factors but particularly decreased aggregate growth efficiency and consumption efficiency. Comparing biomass and diversity trends through other major transitions in the history of animal life has the potential to shed light on the relationship between physical environmental change and ecosystems evolution.},

We propose that community assembly theory provides a framework for addressing this question. Local community assembly rules can be defined by evaluating how native species’ traits interact with community filters to affect species abundance. Evaluation of exotic species against this benchmark indicates that exotics that follow assembly rules behave like natives, while those exhibiting novel interactions with community filters can greatly underperform or outperform natives. Additionally, advantages gained by exotics over natives following disturbance can be explained by accounting for extrinsic assembly processes that bias exotic traits toward ruderal strategies.},

	abstract = {For the last years scale issues have contributed to the understanding of the complex organization of communities. In practice however the choice of observational scales remains one of the major issues of discussion among ecologists. Case studies showing the implications of tuning up the observational scales are still needed to illustrate the crucial role played by sampling designs on the perception of population and community variability. On the ground of simulations on real data sets, this paper presents empirical evidence showing how the abundance patterns of benthic intertidal species change according to the scale (grain size and extent) of observation. A field experimental study was carried out in which abundance of rocky shore intertidal benthic species and physical factors associated to the substratum were recorded in contiguous quadrats (5×10 cm) along three 100-m transect lines. Subsampling routines were developed to generate different scale scenarios by monotonically increasing the grain size and extent of the data. Results showed that: 1) changes in the observational grain size and extent convey different information about the spatial patterning of the recorded factors, and 2) the strength of the relationship between species abundance and physical factors tends to decrease as extent increase. Under the continuous simulations of scale scenarios along transects, variance estimation was the criterion adopted to make explicit the degree of precision in patterns description obtained by each scale scenario. The experimental variogram demonstrated to be a useful statistic for estimating the variance associated with discrete levels along the continuous varying function of scale.},

Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

Based on this model, we develop score tests to test for treatment effect in the data in which observations in the form of counts are recorded before and after applying a therapy. Results of a small simulation experiment, to study small sample behaviour of a score test and a likelihood ratio test, are reported and the PVC data are analysed. Both the score and the likelihood ratio tests show good level properties. Either the score tests or the likelihood ratio tests can be used for testing the presence of treatment effect. The score tests, however, may be preferable because they use estimates of the parameters only under the null hypothesis and in the important range π{\textless}0.5 power of the score test statistic S1 is slightly better than the likelihood ratio statistic LR1.

We analyze the relationship between local and regional diversity in tropical marine communities spanning approximately 13 Myr of the Late Ordovician to test for the role of local processes in structuring local communities. We find a significant and strong positive relationship between local and regional diversity, indicating that local communities were not saturated with species and that local processes did not exert a dominant influence on local diversity. Rather, local diversity was influenced more by regional oceanographic processes that governed the size of the regional species pool. This evidence for unsaturated communities is consistent with the Walker and Valentine hierarchically structured niche model of global diversification. These results come at the beginning of the 200-Myr Paleozoic plateau in both local and global diversity and therefore raise the question whether local communities were ever saturated with species during the Paleozoic. Similar studies need to be conducted during other times in the Paleozoic to determine if this is indeed the case.},

As species are added to and removed from such communities via colonization and extinction, changes in the degree of nestedness can be expected. Such temporal changes were examined by comparing modern distributions of plants, arthropods, and various vertebrate groups with available historical records. The time scales for these comparisons ranged from post-glacial time periods to months and days. Nested subset patterns were found for various taxonomic groups, being especially marked in fragmented biotas thought to be shaped by local extinctions. However, several biotas assembled by colonization and/or dispersal also exhibited nested patterns. Comparisons of the same communities at different time periods generally showed little change in degree of "nestedness". The prevalence of nested subset patterns in assemblages shaped by both extinction and colonization indicates that this type of structure may be a more general property of communities, rather than a specific attribute of islands undergoing biotic relaxation.},

	abstract = {The nested subset hypothesis was formulated to describe and explain patterns in the community structure of insular mammal faunas which are in the state of ‘relaxation’. The hypothesis states that the species comprising a depauperate fauna should constitute a proper subset of those in richer faunas, and that an archipelago of such faunas arranged by species richness should present a nested series. The non-randomness of this pattern is evaluated for montane mammals in the American Southwest using Monte Carlo simulations under two sets of conditions. First, we constructed model archipelagos with the observed distribution of species richnesses, drawing individual species at random (without replacement) from the species pool (RANDOM0). Secondly, we constructed model archipelagos having the observed distribution of species richnesses, but weighted the selection of species by their actual frequencies of occurrence (RANDOM1). The degree of nestedness in the model archipelagos was then used to assess the non-randomness of the observed structure. Actual Southwestern mammal faunas have a far more nested structure than model archipelagos produced by either RANDOM0 or RANDOM1, and there is virtually zero probability that observed structure is represented in the distribution of scores from either simulation run. Similar analyses were conducted on other archipelagos to determine the generality of this relationship and to identify variables putatively responsible for its production. Mammal faunas of large islands off the coast of Maine, U.S.A., studied by Crowell (1986) also comprise nested subsets, as do those inhabiting islands off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, studied by Lawlor (1983). Significantly, when the Baja archipelago is divided into landbridge islands (which are presumed to be relaxing to lower species level) and oceanic islands (where species number is limited by successful overwater dispersal), only the former show significant nestedness under the more stringent conditions of RANDOM1. These results and theoretical considerations suggest that selective extinction of species may be chiefly responsible for the nestedness in natural archipelagos. Our conclusions have obvious implications for the design of natural preserves (e.g. SLOSS): several small fragments of a single biota can be expected to support nested subsets of the species originally present or that would likely be retained in a single large preserve. Even more sobering are arguments raised which suggest that the faunas of preserves established in different habitats within the same biome might be expected to converge in composition via selective extinction.},

Here we report for the first time on the lithic and fossil assemblages that were recovered by Mary Leakey from the site. The lithic assemblage is one of the largest of any Oldowan site and is characterized by a core-and-flake technology with simple flaking techniques and minimal reduction of cores. Retouched flake frequencies and battered tools are higher than those reported for Olduvai Bed I and Lower Bed II assemblages, but flaking schemes are poorly organized. The fossil assemblage is well-preserved, taxonomically-rich, but dominated by bovids, and includes abundant feeding traces of both hominins and carnivores. Hominins are inferred to have broken the majority of limb bones at the site for access to marrow, while both carnivores and hominins likely had access to at least some flesh. HWK EE may represent one of the last Homo habilis sites at Olduvai Gorge, and is important to understanding the behavioral and cultural mechanisms that led to the emergence of the Acheulean and Homo erectus in the region.},

              Probabilistic approaches to phylogenetic inference have recently gained traction in paleontological studies. Because they directly model processes of evolutionary change, probabilistic methods facilitate a deeper assessment of variability in evolutionary patterns by weighing evidence for competing models. Although phylogenetic methods used in paleontological studies have generally assumed that evolution proceeds by splitting cladogenesis, extensions to previous models help explore the potential for morphological and temporal data to provide differential support for contrasting modes of evolutionary divergence. Recent methodological developments have integrated ancestral relationships into probabilistic phylogenetic methods. These new approaches rely on parameter-rich models and sophisticated inferential methods, potentially obscuring the respective contributions of data and models. In this study, we describe a simple likelihoodist approach that combines probabilistic models of morphological evolution and fossil preservation to reconstruct both cladogenetic and anagenetic relationships. By applying this approach to a data set of fossil hominins, we demonstrate the capability of existing models to unveil evidence for anagenesis presented by morphological and temporal data. This evidence was previously recognized by qualitative assessments, but largely ignored by quantitative phylogenetic analyses. For example, we find support for directly ancestral relationships in multiple lineages:
              Sahelanthropus
              is ancestral to later hominins;
              Australopithecus anamensis

              Australopithecus afarensis

              is ancestral to

	abstract = {Bone surface modifications have become important indicators of hominin behavior and ecology at prehistoric archaeological sites. However, the method by which we identify and interpret these marks remains largely unchanged despite decades of research, relying on qualitative criteria and lacking standardization between analysts. Recently, zooarchaeologists have begun using new technologies capable of capturing 3-D data from bone surface modifications to advance our knowledge of these informative traces. However, an important step in this research has been overlooked and after years of work, we lack both a universal and replicable protocol and an understanding of the precision of these techniques. Here we propose a new standard for identifying bone surface modifications using high-resolution 3-D data and offer a systematic and replicable approach for researchers to follow. Data were collected with a white-light non-contact confocal profilometer and analyzed with Digital Surf's Mountains® software. Our data show that when methods are standardized, results between researchers are statistically indistinguishable. Multivariate analyses using the measured parameters allow discrimination between stone tool cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks with 97.5\% accuracy. Application of this method to fossil specimens resulted in 100\% correspondence with identifications made by an experienced analyst using macroscopic observations of qualitative features of bone surface modifications. High-resolution 3-D analyses of bone surface modifications have great potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of taphonomic research, but only if our methods are replicable and precise.},

	abstract = {Trophic downgrading is a major concern for conservation scientists. The largest consumers in many ecosystems have become either rare or extirpated, leading to worry over the loss of their ecosystem function. However, trophic downgrading is not a uniquely modern phenomenon. The extinction of 34 genera of megafauna from North America {\textasciitilde}13,000 years ago must have led to widespread changes in terrestrial ecosystem function. Studies that have examined the event address impacts on vegetative structure, small mammal communities, nutrient cycling, and fire regimes. Relatively little attention has been paid to community changes at the top of the food chain. Here, we examine the response of carnivores in North America to the Pleistocene extinction. We employ fossil data to model the climatic niche of endemic canids, including the extinct dire wolf, Canis dirus, over the last 20,000 years. Quantifying the abiotic niche allows us to account for expected changes due to climate fluctuations over the late Quaternary; deviations from expected responses likely reveal influences of competition and/or resource availability. We quantify the degree of niche conservatism and interspecific overlap to assess species and community responses among canids. We also include in our analyses a novel introduced predator, the domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris, which accompanied humans into the New World. We find that endemic canid species display low fidelity to their climatic niche through time, We find that survivors increasingly partition their climatic niche throughout the Holocene and, surprisingly, do not expand into niche space presumably vacated by the extinction of very large carnivores. These results suggest that loss of megaherbivores and competition with humans likely outweighed advantages conferred from the loss of very large predators. We also find that wolves and dogs decrease their niche overlap throughout the Holocene, suggesting a distinctive relationship between dogs and man. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Many processes can contribute to macroevolutionary change. This fact is the source of the wide variety of macroevolutionary change across time and taxa as well as the bane of paleobiological research trying to understand how macroevolution works. Here, I present a general framework for understanding the variety of macroevolutionary phenomena. Based on Price's theorem, this framework provides a simple quantitative means to understand (1) the macroevolutionary processes that are possible and (2) the way those processes interact with each other. The major qualitative features of macroevolution depend first on the number of processes that co-occur and then on the magnitudes and evolutionary directions of those processes. Species selection, the major macroevolutionary process, consists of patterns of differential rates of speciation and extinction. Its macroevolutionary efficacy depends on the presences of sufficient microevolutionary change. Conversely, microevolutionary change is limited in power by the independent evolution of species, and species selection acting across populations of species can amplify or suppress microevolution. Non-trends may result if species selection sufficiently neutralizes microevolution and may yield stable macroevolutionary patterns over many millions of years.},

Previous investigations of the influence of phylogeny on community structure have generally shown that congeneric species are more frequent than would be expected if communities were randomly assembled. Because, under most theories of coexistence, stable coexistence requires ecological differences between species, the apparent excess of coexisting congeners suggests that trait differences important to coexistence must be recently evolved, arising near the tips of phylogenetic trees. 2 We test this hypothesis in two meadow plant communities for which we have good evidence of niche segregation along axes defined by hydrological conditions. 3 Niche overlaps were calculated and compared against null models for (i) all species in the community, (ii) species within genera, (iii) genera within families, (iv) families within the eudicots and monocots, and (v) eudicots and monocots. 4 Against expectation, we found that community structure was the cumulative result of niche separation arising at a range of phylogenetic levels and therefore that niche differences have been accumulated through the evolutionary history of species.},

Contrary to expectations, our analyses reveal a nonlinear relationship between abundance and extinction rates, with rare and abundant genera exhibiting rates elevated over those of genera of moderate abundance. This U-shaped pattern is a persistent feature of the post-Paleozoic history of marine bivalves and provides one possible explanation for why we find strong support for heterogeneous extinction rates among genera grouped by similarity in abundance yet effectively no net relationship among these rates when using models of directional selection on abundance.},

	abstract = {The mere existence of speciation and extinction make macroevolutionary processes possible. Speciation and extinction introduce discontinuities in the microevolutionary change within lineages by initiating, disrupting, and terminating the continuity of species lineages. Within a clade, speciation and extinction become potent means of macroevolution in and of themselves. This process, termed species selection, is a macroevolutionary analogue of natural selection, with species playing an analogous part akin to that played by organisms in microevolution. Regardless, it has proven difficult to think about levels of selection. The concept of species sorting was introduced to help our thinking on this issue by identifying two sources of uncertainty: uncertainty in the level that selection acts and uncertainty about if the pattern of selection is in fact caused at all. Thanks to insights from evolutionary transitions in individuality, we now know more about how to identify the level of selection and how to parse the causal structure in hierarchical evolutionary circumstances. We know that if the fitness of organisms causes the fitness of more inclusive species then they must covary. However, there is no evidence of such a covariance between fitness. This covariance is just not observed; neither between cells and organisms nor between organisms and species. Rather, speciation and extinction rates appear to be completely divorced from organismal fitness. With this insight, the concept of sorting only covers the two processes of selection and drift. I argue that we are better off focusing on understanding the processes of species selection and drift and that there is therefore no further need for the concept of species sorting.},

As an example, we compare the relationship of the extant leopard, Panthera pardus, and its preferred prey in modern foodwebs, with the relationship of fossil leopards (from the Member 1 fossil faunal assemblage at Swartkrans Cave), and their likely prey. The results suggest that Swartkrans Member I leopards depended heavily on Papio baboons, with some lesser contribution from Hyrax (Procavia sp.). The approach has considerable potential for elucidating the preferred prey of extinct predators such as sabertooth cats.},

	abstract = {As only limited insight into behaviour is available from the archaeological record, much of our understanding of historical changes in human cognition is restricted to identifying changes in brain size and architecture. Using both absolute and residual brain size estimates, we show that hominin brain evolution was likely to be the result of a mix of processes; punctuated changes at approximately 100 kya, 1 Mya and 1.8 Mya are supplemented by gradual within-lineage changes in Homo erectus and Homo sapiens sensu lato. While brain size increase in Homo in Africa is a gradual process, migration of hominins into Eurasia is associated with step changes at approximately 400 kya and approximately 100 kya. We then demonstrate that periods of rapid change in hominin brain size are not temporally associated with changes in environmental unpredictability or with long-term palaeoclimate trends. Thus, we argue that commonly used global sea level or Indian Ocean dust palaeoclimate records provide little evidence for either the variability selection or aridity hypotheses explaining changes in hominin brain size. Brain size change at approximately 100 kya is coincident with demographic change and the appearance of fully modern language. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the external pressures driving encephalization, which will only be filled by novel applications of the fossil, palaeoclimatic and archaeological records.},

However, it is difficult to reveal the mechanisms if broad sense beta-diversity indices (i.e. yielding identical values under nestedness and species replacement) are used. Partitioning beta diversity into turnover (caused by species replacement from site to site) and nestedness-resultant components (caused by nested species losses) could provide a unique way to understand the variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Here, we collected occupancy data of breeding birds and lizards on land-bridge islands in an inundated lake in eastern China. We decomposed beta diversity of breeding bird and lizard communities into spatial turnover and nestedness-resultant components to assess their relative contributions and respective relationships to differences in island area, isolation, and habitat richness. Our results showed that spatial turnover contributed more to beta diversity than the nestedness-resultant component. The degree of isolation had no significant effect on overall beta diversity or its components, neither for breeding birds nor for lizards. In turn, in both groups the nestedness-resultant component increased with larger differences in island area and habitat richness, respectively, while turnover component decreased with them. The major difference among birds and lizards was a higher relevance of nestedness-resultant dissimilarity in lizards, suggesting that they are more prone to local extinctions derived from habitat fragmentation. The dominance of the spatial turnover component of beta diversity suggests that all islands have potential conservation value for breeding bird and lizard communities.},

Temporal turnover is usually quantified using a variety of metrics initially developed to capture spatial change. However, temporal turnover is the consequence of unidirectional community dynamics resulting from processes such as population growth, colonisation and local extinction. Here, we develop a framework based on community dynamics and propose a new temporal turnover measure. A simulation study and an analysis of an estuarine fish community both clearly demonstrate that our proposed turnover measure offers additional insights relative to spatial context-based metrics. Our approach reveals whether community turnover is due to shifts in community composition or in community abundance and identifies the species and/or environmental factors that are responsible for any change.},

	abstract = {In mountain areas, the distribution of plant communities is affected by both regional and microhabitat conditions. The degree to which these different spatial factors contribute to plant communities is not well understood, because few studies have used a uniform sampling methodology to measure trait variation across the range of ecological scales. In this study, a stratified sampling method was used to study community weighted leaf traits and environment factors at different spatial (transect and plot) scales. We measured 6 leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf tissue density, leaf thickness, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content) in 258 communities from 57 sites in 9 transects nested within 3 vegetation zones. These communities are located in the loess hilly and gully area of the Yanhe river watershed. We coupled climatic factors at the transect scale with topographic and edaphic factors at the plot scale using multilevel regression modeling to analyze the trait variation associated with spatial scales. At the transect scale, the mean annual rainfall showed a highly significant positive effect on the leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) (p \&lt; 0.01), while it had a highly significant negative effect on leaf thickness (LT) and leaf tissue density (LTD) (p \&lt; 0.001) and a significant negative effect on leaf carbon concentration (LCC) (p \&lt; 0.05), explaining 10.91\%, 36.08\%, 57.25\% and 66.01\% of LTD, LT, LCC and LNC variation at transect scale respectively. At a plot scale, the slope aspect showed a highly significant positive effect on specific leaf area (SLA) and LNC but a highly significant negative effect on LT and LTD. The soil water content had a significant negative effect on LT (p \&lt; 0.05) and LTD (p \&lt; 0.001) while soil organic matter showed a positive effect on SLA (p \&lt; 0.001) and LNC (p \&lt; 0.01). Totally, plot scale variables explained 7.28\%, 43.60\%, 46.43\%, 75.39\% and 81.17\% of LCC, LT, LNC, LTD and SLA variation. The elevation showed positive effect only on LCC (p \&lt; 0.05). The results confirmed the existence of consistent trait–environment relationships at both transect and plot scales. These trait–environment relationships at different spatial scales will provide mechanistic understanding on the vegetation community assembly in the study area. Practically, ignoring trait variation within transects will underestimate roles of microhabitat filters in community assembly, and leads to the homogenization of restoration species. This will be like the past restoration plans and programs, causing serious environmental problems such as dwarf trees and soil desiccation.},

	abstract = {Through natural population changes and experimental field removals, we tested the hypothesis that Least Flycatchers (Empidonax minimus) restrict habitat use by socially subordinate American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla). On a 10-ha site 2-yr-and-older (ASY), but not yearling (SY), male redstarts avoided the sector occupied by flycatchers from 1975 to 1980, but preferred this sector from 1981 to 1985 when flycatchers were absent. Vegetation changed subtly on the site but could not account for the sudden shift in redstart settlement pattern. On 6 4-ha sites ASY male redstarts were most abundant in years of Least Flycatcher absence. On the 5 4-ha sites from which Least Flycatchers either disappeared independently or were removed experimentally between 1981 and 1984, redstart abundance increased on four and remained constant on the fifth; on three control areas redstart numbers declined during the same period. Least Flycatchers recolonized one removal site, and ASY redstart abundance subsequently declined. SY male redstart abundance varied inversely with that of ASY male redstarts. We conclude that flycatchers influenced the distribution of ASY male redstarts directly, and that of SY males indirectly, more than either vegetation structure or other habitat characteristics. At no spatial scale examined, however, did total redstart abundance (ASY + SY) vary inversely with that of Least Flycatchers; in fact, their total abundances correlated positively at a regional scale. These findings, combined with a model for asymmetric competition for mutually preferred habitat (Pimm et al. 1985, Rosenzweig 1985), illustrate how a socially dominant competitor could lead to a broadening rather than a narrowing of the habitat breadth of a subordinate species. We show that competitor species abundances need not vary inversely and that age classes may be affected differentially. This species interaction illustrates subtleties and complexities of how competition can modify avian habitat selection.},

The model is based on the dynamics of species turnover in microsites, and incorporates localized competition, non-uniform seed dispersal and aspects of spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity. These factors, which are not included in most standard competition models, allow stable coexistence of trophically equivalent species due to:(a)Differences in life-history ‘strategy’. (b)Input of seeds from neaby habitats (spatial Mass Effect). (c)Differences in demographic responses to environmental fluctuations (temporal Mass Effect). (d)Turnover in species composition between different habitat patches. Quantitative descriptive studies are presented, demonstrating the occurrence of vegetation patterns predicted on the basis of the hypothesized mechanisms. We also review previously proposed mechanisms that would allow trophically equivalent species to coexist, and explore the theoretical and methodological implications of recognizing coexistence mechanisms independent of trophic niche differentiation. In particular, we propose that these mechanisms contribute to the dissimilarity of within-community replicate samples and the maintenance of many rare species in plant communities.},

One is a 24-ha subtropical forest in Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, China. The other is a 50-ha tropical rain forest in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Spatial point pattern models were applied to investigate the contributions of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity and their interactions to the formation of the SARs in the two sites. The results showed that, although dispersal and habitat heterogeneity each could significantly contribute to the SARs, each alone was insufficient to explain the SARs. Their joint effects sufficiently explained the real SARs, suggesting that heterogeneous habitat and dispersal limitation are two predominant mechanisms for maintaining the spatial distributions of the species in these two forests. These results add to our understanding of the ecological processes underlying the spatial variation of SARs in natural forest communities.},

High-precision U-Pb dating reveals that the extinction peak occurred just before 252.28 ± 0.08 million years ago, after a decline of 2 per mil (‰) in δ13C over 90,000 years, and coincided with a δ13C excursion of −5‰ that is estimated to have lasted ≤20,000 years. The extinction interval was less than 200,000 years and synchronous in marine and terrestrial realms; associated charcoal-rich and soot-bearing layers indicate widespread wildfires on land. A massive release of thermogenic carbon dioxide and/or methane may have caused the catastrophic extinction.

	abstract = {A number of statistical tests have been developed to determine what type of dynamics underlie observed changes in morphology in evolutionary time series, based on the pattern of change within the time series. The theory of the 'scaled maximum', the 'log-rate-interval' (LRI) method, and the Hurst exponent all operate on the same principle of comparing the maximum change, or rate of change, in the observed dataset to the maximum change expected of a random walk. Less change in a dataset than expected of a random walk has been interpreted as indicating stabilizing selection, while more change implies directional selection. The 'runs test' in contrast, operates on the sequencing of steps, rather than on excursion. Applications of these tests to computer generated, simulated time series of known dynamical form and various levels of additive noise indicate that there is a fundamental asymmetry in the rate of type II errors of the tests based on excursion: they are all highly sensitive to noise in models of directional selection that result in a linear trend within a time series, but are largely noise immune in the case of a simple model of stabilizing selection. Additionally, the LRI method has a lower sensitivity than originally claimed, due to the large range of LRI rates produced by random walks. Examination of the published results of these tests show that they have seldom produced a conclusion that an observed evolutionary time series was due to directional selection, a result which needs closer examination in light of the asymmetric response of these tests.},

This study marks the first radioisotopic dating of any early hominin site in China beyond the range of mass spectrometric U-series dating. The weighted mean of six meaningful age measurements, 0.77 ± 0.08 million years (Myr, mean ± s.e.m.), provides the best age estimate for lower cultural layers 7–10. Together with previously reported U-series dating of speleothem calcite and palaeomagnetic stratigraphy, as well as sedimentological considerations, these layers may be further correlated to S6–S7 in Chinese loess stratigraphy or marine isotope stages (MIS) 17–19, in the range of {\textasciitilde}0.68 to 0.78 Myr ago. These ages are substantially older than previously supposed and may imply early hominin’s presence at the site in northern China through a relatively mild glacial period corresponding to MIS 18.},

	abstract = {The Homo erectus cranium found at Gongwangling, near Lantian, China, and dated to ≈1.2 ma BP has been analyzed with respect to its evolutionary position. However, the remains, and especially the internal and external surfaces of the neurocranium, present a series of marked abnormalities. These irregularities consist principally of a pronounced cresting and scalloping of the external surface of the frontal bone and anterior parietal bone and a similar alteration of the internal surface of a mid transverse section of parietal bone that connects with the fossilization break across the anterior parietal bone. There is no obvious exposure of diploë on the surfaces. Woo (Vertebrata PalAsiatica 10:1–16, 1966) briefly ascribed these abnormalities to postmortem erosion, and Caspari (Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 102:565–568, 1997) has attributed the irregularities of the right supraorbital torus to antemortem trauma. It has been suggested that the pervasive neurocranial alterations might be pathological. Computerized tomography (CT) analysis of the frontal and parietal bones revealed complete radiopacity of the anterior half of the fossil; it is possible to distinguish large frontal sinuses but other details, including in the area of the purported traumatic lesion, are invisible. However, in the posterior frontal bone and preserved portions of the parietal bone the diploë and tables are discernible. Externally on the frontoparietal section and internally on the transverse parietal piece, there are clear erosional lacunae in the associated table, combined with a thin layer of matrix which obscures the eroded diploë externally. The superficial irregularities are therefore due to postmortem taphonomic alterations of the bone and not pathological processes. In addition, it is apparent that the two pieces were embedded in the matrix at different angles, resulting in their differential erosion.},

A data set consisting of 505 faunal lists distributed among 40 stratigraphic intervals and six environmental zones was used to investigate how variation in alpha and beta diversity influenced global diversity through the Paleozoic, and especially during the Ordovician radiations. As first shown by Bambach (1977), alpha diversity increased by 50 to 70 percent in offshore marine environments during the Ordovician and then remained essentially constant for the remainder of the Paleozoic. The increase is insufficient, however, to account for the 300 percent rise observed in global generic diversity. It is shown that beta diversity among level, soft-bottom communities also increased significantly during the early Paleozoic. This change is related to enhanced habitat selection, and presumably increased overall specialization, among diversifying taxa during the Ordovician radiations. Combined with alpha diversity, the measured change in beta diversity still accounts for only about half of the increase in global diversity. Other sources of increase are probably not related to variation in gamma diversity but rather to appearance and/or expansion of organic reefs, hardground communities, bryozoan thickets, and crinoid gardens during the Ordovician.},

Here we report new Early Pliocene hominid discoveries and their palaeoenvironmental context from the fossiliferous deposits of As Duma, Gona Western Margin (GWM), Afar, Ethiopia. The hominid dental anatomy (occlusal enamel thickness, absolute and relative size of the first and second lower molar crowns, and premolar crown and radicular anatomy) indicates attribution to Ardipithecus ramidus. The combined radioisotopic and palaeomagnetic data suggest an age of between 4.51 and 4.32 million years for the hominid finds at As Duma. Diverse sources of data (sedimentology, faunal composition, ecomorphological variables and stable carbon isotopic evidence from the palaeosols and fossil tooth enamel) indicate that the Early Pliocene As Duma sediments sample a moderate rainfall woodland and woodland/grassland.},

	abstract = {The kinetic model of taxonomic diversity predicts that the long-term diversification of taxa within any large and essentially closed ecological system should approximate a logistic process controlled by changes in origination and extinction rates with changing numbers of taxa. This model is tested with a new compilation of numbers of metazoan families known from Paleozoic stages (including stage-level subdivisions of the Cambrian). These data indicate the occurrence of two intervals of logistic diversification within the Paleozoic. The first interval, spanning the Vendian and Cambrian, includes an approximately exponential increase in families across the Precambrian-Cambrian Boundary and a "pseudoequilibrium" through the Middle and Late Cambrian, caused by diversity-dependent decrease in origination rate and increase in extinction rate. The second interval begins with a rapid re-diversification in the Ordovician, which leads to a tripling of familial diversity during a span of 50 Myr; by the end of the Ordovician diversity attains a new dynamic equilibrium that is maintained, except for several extinction events, for nearly 200 Myr until near the end of the Paleozoic. A "two-phase" kinetic model is constructed to describe this heterogeneous pattern of early Phanerozoic diversification. The model adequately describes the "multiple equilibria," the asymmetrical history of the "Cambrian fauna," the extremely slow initial diversification of the later "Paleozoic fauna," and the combined patterns of origination and extinction in both faunas. It is suggested that this entire pattern of diversification reflects the early success of ecologically generalized taxa and their later replacement by more specialized taxa.},

	abstract = {A simple equilibrial model for the growth and maintenance of Phanerozoic global marine taxonomic diversity can be constructed from considerations of the behavior of origination and extinction rates with respect to diversity. An initial postulate that total rate of diversification is proportional to number of taxa extant leads to an exponential model for early phases of diversification. This model appears to describe adequately the “explosive” diversification of known metazoan orders across the Precambrian-Cambrian Boundary, suggesting that no special event, other than the initial appearance of Metazoa, is necessary to explain this phenomenon. As numbers of taxa increase, the rate of diversification should become “diversity dependent.” Ecological factors should cause the per taxon rate of origination to decline and the per taxon rate of extinction to increase. If these relationships are modeled as simple linear functions, a logistic description of the behavior of taxonomic diversity through time results. This model appears remarkably consistent with the known pattern of Phanerozoic marine ordinal diversity as a whole. Analysis of observed rates of ordinal origination also indicates these are to a large extent diversity dependent; however, diversity dependence is not immediately evident in rates of ordinal extinction. Possible explanations for this pattern are derived from considerations of the size of higher taxa and from simulations of their diversification. These suggest that both the standing diversity and the pattern of origination of orders may adequately reflect the behavior of species diversity through time; however, correspondence between rates of ordinal and species extinction may deteriorate with progressive loss of information resulting from incomplete sampling of the fossil record.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies suggest that the transition from Australopithecus to Homo was characterized by evolutionary innovation, resulting in the emergence and coexistence of a diversity of forms. However, the evolutionary processes necessary to drive such a transition have not been examined. Here, we apply statistical tests developed from quantitative evolutionary theory to assess whether morphological differences among late australopith and early Homo species in Africa have been shaped by natural selection. Where selection is demonstrated, we identify aspects of morphology that were most likely under selective pressure, and determine the nature (type, rate) of that selection. Results demonstrate that selection must be invoked to explain an Au. africanus—Au. sediba—Homo transition, while transitions from late australopiths to various early Homo species that exclude Au. sediba can be achieved through drift alone. Rate tests indicate that selection is largely directional, acting to rapidly differentiate these taxa. Reconstructions of patterns of directional selection needed to drive the Au. africanus—Au. sediba—Homo transition suggest that selection would have affected all regions of the skull. These results may indicate that an evolutionary path to Homo without Au. sediba is the simpler path and/or provide evidence that this pathway involved more reliance on cultural adaptations to cope with environmental change.},

	abstract = {1. Spatial autocorrelation is an important source of bias in most spatial analyses. We explored the bias introduced by spatial autocorrelation on the explanatory and predictive power of species' distribution models, and make recommendations for dealing with the problem. 2. Analyses were based on the distribution of two species of freshwater turtle and two virtual species with simulated spatial structures within two equally sized areas located on the Iberian Peninsula. Sequential permutations of environmental variables were used to generate predictor variables that retained the spatial structure of the original variables. Univariate models of species' distributions using generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and classification tree analysis (CTA) were fitted for each variable permutation. Variation of accuracy measures with spatial autocorrelation of the original predictor variables, as measured by Moran's I, was analysed and compared between models. The effects of systematic subsampling of the data set and the inclusion of a contagion term to deal with spatial autocorrelation in models were assessed with projections made with GLM, as it was with this method that estimates of significance based on randomizations were obtained. 3. Spatial autocorrelation was shown to represent a serious problem for niche-based species' distribution models. Significance values were found to be inflated up to 90-fold. 4. In general, GAM and CTA performed better than GLM, although all three methods were vulnerable to the effects of spatial autocorrelation. 5. The procedures utilized to reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation had varying degrees of success. Subsampling was partially effective in avoiding the inflation effect, whereas the inclusion of a contagion term fully eliminated or even overcompensated for this effect. Direct estimation of probability using variable simulations was effective, yet seemed to show some residual spatial autocorrelation effects. 6. Synthesis and applications. Given the expected inflation in the estimates of significance when analysing spatially autocorrelated variables, these need to be adjusted. The reliability and value of niche-based distribution models for management and other applied ecology purposes can be improved if certain techniques and procedures, such as the null model approach recommended in this study, are implemented during the model-building process.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many authors have attempted to determine whether local processes (such as competitive exclusion) result in local species richness below that of a local community assembled only by dispersal from a larger regional species pool. To do this they hypothesize that no local processes are significant and that local communities are assembled by dispersal only (Dispersal Assembly Hypothesis or DAH). Some authors have presumed that a prediction of this hypothesis is that, if many regions of similar ecological type (e. g., grassland, temperate deciduous forest, etc.) are compared then local richness will be the same fixed proportion of regional richness, across all regions. To compare this putative prediction with observed data, they plot local richness on the vertical axis vs. regional richness on the horizontal axis and discover how well a straight line fits: if it fits well then they accept the hypothesis and they take the slope as an estimate of the fixed proportion; if it fits poorly (usually by curving down for larger regional pools), then they reject the hypothesis and they presume that local processes are significant. In the present paper, I hypothesize DAH, and for each of two different species relative abundance distributions and predict, by simulation, the probability distribution of species richness in a local community, for a full spectrum of local community sample sizes. The plot of the expected values of these predicted distributions vs. regional richness (for a constant local sample size) and vs. increasing local sample size (for constant regional richness) is not a straight line in either case, but always curves downward. Thus, a straight line (proportional sampling) is never a prediction of DAH, so that looking for straight lines in data plots is irrelevant to testing DAH. Finally, I describe how to compare these predictions to observed data to test whether local processes significantly limit local species richness.},

We report excavations of cave sediments that were removed from the Feldhofer caves in 1856. These deposits have yielded over 60 human skeletal fragments, along with a large series of Paleolithic artifacts and faunal material. Our analysis of this material represents the first interdisciplinary analysis of Neandertal remains incorporating genetic, direct dating, and morphological dimensions simultaneously. Three of these skeletal fragments fit directly on Neandertal 1, whereas several others have distinctively Neandertal features. At least three individuals are represented in the skeletal sample. Radiocarbon dates for Neandertal 1, from which a mtDNA sequence was determined in 1997, and a second individual indicate an age of ≈40,000 yr for both. mtDNA analysis on the same second individual yields a sequence that clusters with other published Neandertal sequences.},

	abstract = {Climate change and land use management practices are major drivers of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. To understand and predict resulting changes in community structures, individual-based and spatially explicit population models are a useful tool but require detailed data sets for each species. More generic approaches are thus needed. Here we present a trait-based functional type approach to model savanna birds. The aim of our model is to explore the response of different bird functional types to modifications in habitat structure. The functional types are characterized by different traits, in particular body mass, which is related to life-history traits (reproduction and mortality) and spatial scales (home range area and dispersal ability), as well as the use of vegetation structures for foraging and nesting, which is related to habitat quality and suitability. We tested the performance of the functional types in artificial landscapes varying in shrub:grass ratio and clumping intensity of shrub patches. We found that an increase in shrub encroachment and a decrease in habitat quality caused by land use mismanagement and climate change endangered all simulated bird functional types. The strength of this effect was related to the preferred habitat. Furthermore, larger-bodied insectivores and omnivores were more prone to extinction due to shrub encroachment compared to small-bodied species. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more sensitive to clumping intensity of shrubs whereas herbivorous and carnivorous birds were most affected by a decreasing amount of grass cover. From an applied point of view, our findings emphasize that policies such as woody plant removal and a reduction in livestock stocking rates to prevent shrub encroachment should prioritize the enlargement of existing grassland patches. Overall, our results show that the combination of an individual-based modelling approach with carefully defined functional types can provide a powerful tool for exploring biodiversity responses to environmental changes. Furthermore, the increasing accumulation of worldwide data sets on species’ core and soft traits (surrogates to determine core traits indirectly) on one side and the refinement of conceptual frameworks for animal functional types on the other side will further improve functional type approaches which consider the sensitivities of multiple species to climate change, habitat loss, and fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Drylands worldwide are experiencing shrub encroachment into grasslands with potential consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Climate change could increase the rate of shrub encroachment, amplify precipitation variability, and thus alter bottom-up processes for animal communities. Desert rodents are important biodiversity elements of arid grasslands and shrublands that exert strong effects on soil, vegetation, and other animal species. We used long-term data from the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico to ask whether bottom-up control of desert rodents changes across shrub encroachment gradients. Our design included spatial blocks with replicated ecological states representing transitions from black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) to honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Grassland-to-shrubland transitions did not produce degraded ecosystems, on average, with reduced net primary production or decreased rodent biomass. However, more rodent biomass was supported on unencroached grasslands following droughts whose frequency and severity may increase in southwestern United States. Hence, the observed evenness in rodent biomass across ecological states should be sensitive to climate change. The best predictors of rodent biomass also differed markedly for two trophic groups. This outcome was explained by considering core-transient dynamics. Granivores were mostly core species that regularly occurred on sites and responded to lagged net primary production at local scales, whereas folivores included transient species (especially Sigmodon hispidus) that responded to lagged precipitation at broader scales via spillover dynamics. Bottom-up processes for desert rodents across shrub invasion gradients were understood by integrating lagged responses to productivity pulses with core-transient structuring of communities.},

As a consequence, the method of examining overlap is more conservative (i.e., rejects the null hypothesis less often) than the standard method when the null hypothesis is true, and it mistakenly fails to reject the null hypothesis more frequently than does the standard method when the null hypothesis is false. Although the method of examining overlap is simple and especially convenient when lists or graphs of confidence intervals have been presented, we conclude that it should not be used for formal significance testing unless the data analyst is aware of its deficiencies and unless the information needed to carry out a more appropriate procedure is unavailable.},

Determining which species are more prone to extinction is vital for conserving Earth's biodiversity and for providing insight into macroevolutionary processes. This paper utilizes the Pliocene to Recent fossil record of mollusks to identify determinants of species' extinction over the past three million years of Earth history.


Location

Western Atlantic.


Methods

We focus on 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; ∼3.264–3.025 Ma) and have either since gone extinct or are still extant. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the vulnerability of these species to extinction as a function of both fundamental (FN) and realized (RN) niche breadth proxies, geographic range size, and amount of suitable area available to them during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ∼21 Ka).


Results

Geographic range size emerged as a key predictor of extinction for the studied mollusk species, with RN breadth and amount of suitable area available during the LGM as secondary predictors. By contrast, FN breadth was not a significant predictor of extinction risk.


Main conclusions

The failure to recover FN breadth as a predictor of extinction may suggest that extinction resistance is achieved when species are more successful in filling the geographic extent of their fundamental tolerances. That is, when it comes to species' survival, being a generalist or specialist sensu stricto may be secondary to the unique historical, dispersal, and biotic constraints that dictate a species' occupation of suitable environments, and consequently of geographic space, at a particular time. Identifying the factors that promote extinction is important because of the time-intensive nature of estimating extinction risk for individual species and populations, and because of the rising concerns about the future of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.},

We demonstrate this process with a synthetic theory of ecological gradients and species richness. Our unified theory rests on four propositions. First, variation in some environmental factor effects variation in the number of individuals creating a gradient. Second, in a uniform environment of fixed area, more individuals lead to more species. Third, the variance of an environmental factor increases with its mean for sites of equal area. Fourth, all nonmonotonic relationships (i.e., hump shaped or U shaped) require a trade‐off in organismal performance or in population characteristics with respect to the environmental gradient. We identify 17 models that link environmental gradients with diversity, show their relationship to our framework, and describe issues surrounding their empirical testing. We illustrate how a general theory can be used to build new models such as that for the U‐shaped productivity‐diversity relationship. Finally, we discuss how our theory could be unified further with other theories of diversity and indicate other areas of ecology that are ripe for unification. By providing an example of the process of theory unification, we hope to encourage such efforts throughout ecology.},

Insufficient attention has been paid to the variety of methods used to construct those curves. There are six different methods based on different combinations of: (1) the pattern of quadrats or areas sampled (nested, contiguous, noncontiguous, or island); (2) whether successively larger areas are constructed in a spatially explicit fashion or not; and (3) whether the curve is constructed from single values or mean values. The resulting six types of curves differ in their shapes, how diversity is encapsulated, and the scales encompassed. Inventory diversity (α) can either represent a single value or a mean value, creating a difference in the focus of the measure. Differentiation diversity (β) can vary in the extent encompassed, and thus the spatial scale, depending on the pattern of quadrat placement. Species-area curves are used for a variety of purposes: extrapolation, setting a common grain, and hypothesis testing. The six types of curves differ in how they are used or interpreted in these contexts. A failure to recognize these differences can result in improper conclusions.

In 30\% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.},

Filling this knowledge gap is crucial for global species management and conservation planning and to understand the potential impact of environmental changes on multiple species. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Terrestrial amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Methods We collected population density estimates for a range of terrestrial vertebrates, including 364 estimates for amphibians, 850 for reptiles, 5,667 for birds and 7,651 for mammals. We contrasted the importance of life history traits and environmental predictors using mixed models and tested different hypotheses to explain the variation in population density for the four groups. We assessed the predictive accuracy of models through cross-validation and mapped the partial response of vertebrate population density to environmental variables globally. Results Amphibians were more abundant in wet areas with high productivity levels, whereas reptiles showed relatively higher densities in arid areas with low productivity and stable temperatures. The density of birds and mammals was typically high in temperate wet areas with intermediate levels of productivity. The models showed good predictive abilities, with pseudo-R2 ranging between 0.68 (birds) and 0.83 (reptiles). Main conclusions Traits determine most of the variation in population density across species, whereas environmental conditions explain the intraspecific variation across populations. Species traits, resource availability and climatic stability have a different influence on the population density of the four groups. These models can be used to predict the average species population density over large areas and be used to explore macroecological patterns and inform conservation analyses.},

	abstract = {Adopting the approach taken with New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides), we present evidence of design complexity in one of the termite-fishing tools of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo. Prior to termite fishing, chimpanzees applied a set of deliberate, distinguishable actions to modify herb stems to fashion a brush-tipped probe, which is different from the form of fishing tools used by chimpanzees in East and West Africa. This means that ‘brush-tipped fishing probes’, unlike ‘brush sticks’, are not a by-product of use but a deliberate design feature absent in other chimpanzee populations. The specialized modifications to prepare the tool for termite fishing, measures taken to repair non-functional brushes and appropriate orientation of the modified end suggest that these wild chimpanzees are attentive to tool modifications. We also conducted experimental trials that showed that a brush-tipped probe is more effective in gathering insects than an unmodified fishing probe. Based on these findings, we suggest that chimpanzees in the Congo Basin have developed an improved fishing probe design.},

	abstract = {Predator?prey interactions play an important role for species composition and community dynamics at local scales, but their importance in shaping large?scale gradients of species richness remains unexplored. Here, we use global range maps, structural equation models (SEM), and comprehensive databases of dietary preferences and body masses of all terrestrial, non?volant mammals worldwide, to test whether (1) prey bottom?up or predator top?down relationships are important drivers of broad?scale species richness gradients once the environment and human influence have been accounted for, (2) predator?prey richness associations vary among biogeographic regions, and (3) body size influences large?scale covariation between predators and prey. SEMs including only productivity, climate, and human factors explained a high proportion of variance in prey richness (R2 = 0.56) but considerably less in predator richness (R2 = 0.13). Adding predator?to?prey or prey?to?predator paths strongly increased the explained variance in both cases (prey R2 = 0.79, predator R2 = 0.57), suggesting that predator?prey interactions play an important role in driving global diversity gradients. Prey bottom?up effects prevailed over productivity, climate, and human influence to explain predator richness, whereas productivity and climate were more important than predator top?down effects for explaining prey richness, although predator top?down effects were still significant. Global predator?prey associations were not reproduced in all regions, indicating that distinct paleoclimate and evolutionary histories (Africa and Australia) may alter species interactions across trophic levels. Stronger cross?trophic?level associations were recorded within categories of similar body size (e.g., large prey to large predators) than between them (e.g., large prey to small predators), suggesting that mass?related energetic and physiological constraints influence broad?scale richness links, especially for large?bodied mammals. Overall, our results support the idea that trophic interactions can be important drivers of large?scale species richness gradients in combination with environmental effects.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have recognized for decades the importance of spatial scale in ecological processes and patterns, as well as the complications scale poses for understanding ecological mechanisms. Here we highlight the opportunity attention to scale offers experimental ecology. Despite many advantages to considering scale, a review of the literature indicates that multi-scale experimental studies are rare. Although much work has focused on scale as a primary factor (e.g. island size), we draw attention to scale as a ‘lurking’ variable: one which influences the relationship between two or more variables that are not usually understood to be scale-dependent. We highlight three basic observations from which scale-dependence arises: abundance increases with area, environmental conditions vary across space, and the effect of an organism on its environment is spatially limited. From these arise first-order scale-dependence, which relates an ecological variable of interest to a measure of scale. Combining first-order relationships together, we can produce second-order scale-dependencies, which occur when the relationship between two or more variables is mediated by scale. It is these relationships that are of particular interest, as they have the potential to confound experimental results. Most ecological experiments have incorporated scale either implicitly or not at all. We suggest that an explicit consideration of scale could help resolve some long-standing debates when scale is turned from a lurking variable into a working variable. Finally, we review and evaluate four different experimental sampling designs and corresponding statistical analyses that can be used to address the effects of scale in ecological experiments.},

We assess the consequences of between-observer differences in counts for estimation of population trends in the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Observer differences in numbers of birds counted were found in 50\% of the 369 species we examined. For many species, observers in later years tended to count more birds than observers in earlier years, suggesting an increase in observer quality over time. Analysis of population trends from 1966 through 1991 indicates that failure to include observers as covariables in the analysis results in an overly optimistic view of population trends.},

Triassic ammonoid genera (spanning {\textasciitilde}166 Myr) shows that eight basic morphotypes appeared within {\textasciitilde}20 Myr of the first appearance of ammonoids. With one exception, these morphotypes persisted throughout the Paleozoic, occurring in {\textasciitilde}75\% of the {\textasciitilde}5-Myr time bins used in this study. Morphotypes were not exclusive to particular lineages. Their persistence was not just a product of phylogenetic constraints or longevity, and multiple iterations of the same morphotypes occurred at different times and in different groups. Although mass extinction events severely condensed the range of morphologic variation and taxonomic diversity, the effects were short lived and most extinct morphotypes were usually iterated within 5 Myr. The most important effect of mass extinctions on ammonoid evolutionary history seems to have been their role in large scale taxonomic turnovers; they effectively eliminated previously dominant orders at the Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) (Agoniatitida), the Devonian/Mississippian (D/M) (Clymeniida), and the Permian/Triassic (P/T) (Goniatitida and Prolecanitida) extinctions. Survivors varied from two (P/T) to four (D/M) and five genera (F/F). These events generated sharp reductions in morphologic disparity at the D/M (58\%) and at the P/T (59\%), but there was a net increase at the F/F (38\%). There was no obvious survival bias for particular morphotypes, but 64\% are interpreted to have been Nautilus-like nektobenthic. The recurrence of particular combinations of morphology and their strong independence of phylogeny are strong arguments for functional constraint. Intervals between mass extinctions seem to have been relatively static in terms of morphotype numbers, in contrast to numbers of genera. Significant decreases in genus diversity (54\%) and morphologic disparity (33\%) commenced in the mid-Permian (Wordian/Capitanian boundary), well before the final P/T event.},

By the use of this technique, a within-habitat analysis was made of the bivalve and polychaete components of soft-bottom marine faunas which differed in latitude, depth, temperature, and salinity. The resulting diversity values were highly correlated with the physical stability and past history of these environments. A stability-time hypothesis was invoked to fit these findings, and, with this hypothesis, predictions were made about the diversities present in certain other environments as yet unstudied. The two types of diversity, based on numerical percentage composition and on number of species, were compared and shown to be poorly correlated with each other. Our data indicated that species number is the more valid diversity measurement. The rarefaction methodology was compared with a number of diversity indexes using identical data. Many of these indexes were markedly influenced by sample size. Good agreement was found between the rarefaction methodology and the Shannon-Wiener information function.},

	abstract = {Intensified exploitation of natural populations and habitats has led to increased mortality rates and decreased abundances of many species. There is a growing concern that this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species to be crossed, with extinction cascades and state shifts in ecosystems as a consequence. When increased mortality rate and decreased abundance of a given species lead to extinction of other species, this species can be characterized as functionally extinct even though it still exists. Although such functional extinctions have been observed in some ecosystems, their frequency is largely unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore the frequency and pattern of functional extinctions in ecological networks. Specifically, we analytically derive critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing their mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the network. Applying this approach on natural and theoretical food webs, we show that the species most likely to go extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is increased but instead another species. Indeed, up to 80\% of all first extinctions are of another species, suggesting that a species/' ecological functionality is often lost before its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we find that large-bodied species at the top of the food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend strong support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological functionality rather than on mere persistence.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem resilience is the inherent ability to absorb various disturbances and reorganize while undergoing state changes to maintain critical functions. When ecosystem resilience is sufficiently degraded by disturbances, ecosystem is exposed at high risk of shifting from a desirable state to an undesirable state. Ecological thresholds represent the points where even small changes in environmental conditions associated with disturbances lead to switch between ecosystem states. There is a growing body of empirical evidence for such state transitions caused by anthropogenic disturbances in a variety of ecosystems. However, fewer studies addressed the interaction of anthropogenic and natural disturbances that often force an ecosystem to cross a threshold which an anthropogenic disturbance or a natural disturbance alone would not have achieved. This fact highlights how little is known about ecosystem dynamics under uncertainties around multiple and stochastic disturbances. Here, we present two perspectives for providing a predictive scientific basis to the management and conservation of ecosystems against multiple and stochastic disturbances. The first is management of predictable anthropogenic disturbances to maintain a sufficient level of biodiversity for ensuring ecosystem resilience (i.e., resilience-based management). Several biological diversity elements appear to confer ecosystem resilience, such as functional redundancy, response diversity, a dominant species, a foundation species, or a keystone species. The greatest research challenge is to identify key elements of biodiversity conferring ecosystem resilience for each context and to examine how we can manage and conserve them. The second is the identification of ecological thresholds along existing or experimental disturbance gradients. This will facilitate the development of indicators of proximity to thresholds as well as the understanding of threshold mechanisms. The implementation of forewarning indicators will be critical particularly when resilience-based management fails. The ability to detect an ecological threshold along disturbance gradients should therefore be essential to establish a backstop for preventing the threshold from being crossed. These perspectives can take us beyond simply invoking the precautionary principle of conserving biodiversity to a predictive science that informs practical solutions to cope with uncertainties and ecological surprises in a changing world.},

The gradients of such trends vary with environment of deposition. Although measurement error and compaction contribute to these regressions, they are primarily the consequence of unsteady, discontinuous sedimentation. The essential character of the unsteadiness may be cyclic or random, but net accumulation is characterized by fluctuations whose magnitudes increase with increasing recurrence interval. Ratios of median long- to short-term accumulation rates provide a measure of the expected completeness of sedimentary stratigraphic sections, at the time scale of the short-term rate.

	abstract = {Understanding the patterns of biodiversity through time and space is a challenging task. However, phylogeny-based macroevolutionary models allow us to account and measure many of the processes responsible for diversity build-up, namely speciation and extinction. The general latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is a well-recognized pattern describing a decline in species richness from the equator pole-wards. Recent macroecological studies in ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi have shown that their LDG is shifted, peaking at temperate rather than tropical latitudes. Here we investigate this phenomenon from a macroevolutionary perspective, focusing on a well-sampled group of edible EM edible mushrooms from the genus Amanita –the Caesar's mushrooms, which follow similar diversity patterns. Our approach consisted in applying a suite of models including: (1) non-trait-dependent time-varying diversification (BAMM), (2) continuous trait-dependent diversification (QuaSSE), and (3) diversity-dependent diversification (DDD). In short, results give strong support for high speciation rates at temperate latitudes (BAMM and QuaSSE). We also find some evidence for different diversity-dependence thresholds in ‘temperate’ and ‘tropical’ subclades, and little differences in diversity due to extinction. We conclude that our analyses on the Caesar's mushrooms give further evidence of a temperate-peaking LDG in EM fungi, highlighting the importance and the implications of macroevolutionary processes in explaining diversity gradients in microorganisms.

Analyses of guilds revealed significant variation. The slopes of the frugivore‐omnivore, insectivore, and granivore guilds were all significantly positive, with that of the frugivore‐omnivore guild being the steepest. In contrast, PEU did not vary significantly with species body mass among raptors. These results were confirmed in analyses using both species values and phylogenetically independent contrasts, and the results do not support the EER in this community. The spatial distribution of resources and mechanisms of interference competition within guilds may explain why most patterns differed from the predictions of the EER. Other sources of variation, including the effects of scale, are also discussed.},

	abstract = {1. Invasive species threaten biodiversity, and their eradication is desirable whenever possible. Deciding whether an invasive species has been successfully eradicated is difficult because of imperfect detection. Two previous studies [Regan et al., Ecology Letters, 9 (2006), 759; Rout et al., Journal of Applied Ecology, 46 (2009), 110] have used a decision theory framework to minimize the total expected cost by finding the number of consecutive surveys without detection (absent surveys) after which a species should be declared eradicated. These two studies used different methods to calculate the probability that the invasive species is present when it has not been detected for a number of surveys. However, neither acknowledged uncertainty in this probability, which can lead to suboptimal solutions. 2. We use info-gap theory to examine the effect of uncertainty in the probability of presence on decision-making. Instead of optimizing performance for an assumed system model, info-gap theory finds the decision among the alternatives considered that is most robust to model uncertainty while meeting a set performance requirement. This is the first application of info-gap theory to invasive species management. 3. We find the number of absent surveys after which eradication should be declared to be relatively robust to uncertainty in the probability of presence. This solution depends on the nominal estimate of the probability of presence, the performance requirement and the cost of surveying, but not the cost of falsely declaring eradication. 4. More generally, to be robust to uncertainty in the probability of presence, managers should conduct at least as many surveys as the number that minimizes the total expected cost. This holds for any nominal model of the probability of presence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Uncertainty is pervasive in ecology and conservation biology. It is therefore crucial to consider its impact on decision-making; info-gap theory provides a way to do this. We find a simple expression for the info-gap solution, which could be applied by eradication managers to make decisions that are robust to uncertainty in the probability of presence.},

For coexisting tropical tree species, the best established demographic trade-off is the growth-survival trade-off. However, we know surprisingly little about co-variation of growth and survival with measures of reproduction. We analysed demographic rates from seed to adult of 282 co-occurring tropical tree and shrub species, including measures of reproduction and accounting for ontogeny. Besides the well-established fast–slow continuum, we identified a second major dimension of demographic variation: a trade-off between recruitment and seedling performance vs. growth and survival of larger individuals (≥ 1 cm dbh) corresponding to a ‘stature–recruitment’ axis. The two demographic dimensions were almost perfectly aligned with two independent trait dimensions (shade tolerance and size). Our results complement recent analyses of plant life-history variation at the global scale and reveal that demographic trade-offs along multiple axes act to structure local communities.},

Assessing the relative influence of local ecological interactions versus regional species pools on local species richness should help bridge this conceptual gap. Plots of local species richness versus regional species pools have been used to address this question, yet after an active quarter‐century of research on the relative influence of local interactions versus regional species pools, consensus remains elusive. We propose a conceptual framework that incorporates spatial scale and ecological interaction strength to reconcile current disparities. We then test this framework using a survey of marine rocky intertidal algal and invertebrate communities from the northeast Pacific. We reach two main conclusions. First, these data show that the power of regional species pools to predict local richness disintegrates at small spatial scales coincident with the scale of biological interactions, when studying ecologically interactive groups of species, and in generally more abiotically stressful habitats (e.g., the high intertidal). Second, conclusions of past studies asserting that the regional species pool is the primary driver of local species richness may be artifacts of large spatial scales or ecologically noninteractive groups of species.},

	abstract = {Although some consensus exists regarding the positive synergism between energy and heterogeneity in increasing species diversity, the role of environmental variability remains controversial. We examine how these factors interact to explain spatial variation in mammal species richness in South America. After taking into account the effects of spatial autocorrelation and area, elevation variability and energy mainly drive spatial variation in mammal species richness. The effect of environmental variability is less important. When different taxonomic groups of mammals are analyzed separately, three ways emerge whereby energy and heterogeneity interact to promote species richness. Heterogeneity may have no effect on species richness, habitat heterogeneity and energy availability contribute independently to species richness, or heterogeneity increases in importance with an increase in energy availability. The partition of species into range size quartiles shows that habitat heterogeneity and temporal instability in the resource supply account for the species richness pattern in the narrowest- ranging species. Habitat heterogeneity is significant also for intermediate ranging species but not for the widest-ranging species. Energy alone drives the species richness pattern in the latter species. The interplay between ecology and biogeographic history may ultimately explain these differences given that narrow- and wide-ranging species show distinct biogeographic patterns, and different taxonomic groups also unequally represent them.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary progress is a trend that relaxes trade-off rules. It begins with the evolution of a key adaptation. It continues with the spread of the key adaptation as the clade that contains it replaces some older clade that lacks it. Key adaptations are those that allow for improvement in at least one organismal function at a reduced fitness cost in other functions. Replacement almost certainly involves more than pure chance. It may not often involve competitive extinction. Instead, species from the new clade produce new species to replace already extinct species from the old clade. The key adaptation gives them a higher competitive speciation rate than old-clade sources of replacement. The process, termed incumbent replacement, proceeds at a rate limited by extinction rate. Thus, replacement often seems linked to mass extinction events. The incumbent-replacement hypothesis explains what we know about the replacement of straight-neck turtles (Amphichelydia) by those that can flex their necks and protect their heads in their shells. This replacement occurred four or five times in different biotic provinces. It happened as long ago as the Cretaceous in Eurasia, and as recently as the Pleistocene in mainland Australia. It was accomplished in Gondwanaland by turtles flexing their necks sideways (Pleurodira), and in the north by those flexing their necks into an S-curve (Cryptodira). As is typical of replacements, amphichelydian replacement took millions of years to accomplish wherever it occurred, and much of it in North America took place in a burst associated with and immediately subsequent to a mass extinction.},

In our studies on two species of Negev desert gerbil, we have taken advantage of the second and third of these functions. Both these gerbils prefer semi-stabilized dune habitat, and both altered their selective use of this habitat and stabilized sand according to experimental changes we made in their populations. Their changes in selectivity agree with a type of optimal foraging theory called ‘isoleg theory’. Isoleg theories provide examples of dipswitch theories – bundles of articulated qualitative predictions – that are easier to falsify than single qualitative predictions. By linking behaviour to population dynamics through isoleg theory, we were able to use the behaviour of the gerbils to reveal the shapes of their competitive isoclines. These have the peculiar non-linear shapes predicted by optimal foraging theory. Finally, when owl predation threatens, the behaviour of Gerbillus allenbyi reveals the shape of their victim isocline. As has long been predicted by predation theory and laboratory experiments, it is unimodal.},

	abstract = {Ecologists need not despair ot discovering the mechanisms that lead to large scale patterns. The search for process at higher scales has already led to enhanced confidence in the patterns and to improvements in their description. For example, species-area relationships turn out to form not one. but three patterns. Each is controlled by gain-loss dynamics at its own scale. At the macroscale, origination and global extinction reign. At the archipelagic scale, immigration and island extinction determine the results. At the local scale, metapopulation processes do. The three scales exhibit species-area curves with systematically different slopes in logarithmic space. We use the three scales of species-area to illuminate the relationship between local and regional diversity. Algebra shows that the latter pattern is an echo of species-area curves, and that those echoes ought to be nearly linear. So. we call the relationship of local and regional diversity, the Echo pattern. Ecology has long known that species-area curves within a region reflect the accumulation of habitat variety. Thus, their connection to Echo patterns argues against concluding that local diversity has little or nothing to do with population interactions. To obtain a pure Echo pattern, one should draw data from independent regions rather than separate islands. The independence allows natural selection to adjust the fundamental niches of species to diversity. Theory suggests that higher diversity should shrink niches, allowing the coexistence of more species locally. Hence, independence should tend to produce the straightest Echoes. However, archipelagic species-area curves predict that even when different islands are used as the regions, the Echoes should show only very gentle curvatures. Flouting theory, some archipelagic Echoes approach an asymptote as regional diversity increases. These must have logarithmic slopes that increase with regional pool size. We do not understand why.},

Paleocommunities exhibited less transient instability—relative to model communities with alternative community organization—and significantly greater probabilities of being locally stable during the mass extinction. Functional patterns that have evolved during an ecosystem's history support significantly more stable communities than hypothetical alternatives.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of the random walk model into stratophenetic analysis marked a turning point by presenting a potential null model for microevolutionary patterns. Random walks are derived from a family of statistical fractals, and their statistics can be reconstructed using appropriate techniques. This paper lays the foundation for the explicit and uniform description of evolutionary mode in stratophenetic series using random walk null models and the information contained within incompletely preserved time series. The method relies upon the iterative analysis of subseries of an original stratophenetic series by measuring the presence of deviations from statistical randomness as the lineage evolves. This measure, and its probability of significance (evaluated using a randomization test), forms the dimensions of a descriptive space for microevolutionary modes. Each stratophenetic series can then be viewed as a journey through this space. Computer simulation of various evolutionary modes demonstrates that different modes, for example stasis and gradualism, have differing trajectories and occupy different regions of the microevolutionary space. The method is applied to two published foraminiferal stratophenetic series, the Mio-Pliocene Globorotalia plesiotumida-tumida punctuated transition and an anagenetic trend in the Late Cretaceous Contusotruncana fornicata-contusa lineage. An anagenetic trend is strongly supported in the latter example, whereas transformation of the Globorotalia species seems to result from the fluctuating effectiveness of constraining processes.},

Comparative methods attempt this by evaluating the statistical fit of trait distributions to a phylogenetic hypothesis under assumed evolutionary models. However, it can be challenging to differentiate between models, with discriminatory power depending on the modes of evolution underlying trait distributions. We suggest rates of ‘trait space saturation’, standardized for limits to evolutionary change, as an additional tool to distinguish between modes of trait evolution. We evaluate this approach using simulations and show that trait space saturation can identify the true model of trait evolution in cases where traditional comparative methods can fail. We illustrate our approach using diverse empirical studies that represent contrasting scenarios of evolutionary radiation.},

	abstract = {A model is developed to explore the potential responses of paleocommunities to disruptions of primary production during times of mass extinction and ecological crisis. Disruptions of primary production are expected to generate bottom-up cascades of secondary extinction, and these are predictable given species richnesses, functional diversity, and trophic link distributions. If, however, consumers are permitted to compensate for the loss of trophic resources by increasing the intensities of their remaining biotic interactions, top-down driven catastrophic increases of secondary extinction emerge from the model. Both bottom-up and top-down effects are themselves controlled by the geometry of the food webs. The general Phanerozoic trends of increasing taxonomic and ecological diversities, as well as the varying strengths of biotic interactions, have led to food webs of increasing complexity. The frequency of catastrophic secondary extinction increases as food web complexity increases, but increased complexity also serves to dampen the magnitude of the secondary extinctions. When intraguild competitive interactions are included in the model, competitively inferior taxa are observed to possess greater probabilities of survival if the guilds are embedded in simple subnetworks of the overall food web. The result is the emergence of post-extinction guilds dominated by those inferior taxa. These results are congruent with empirical observations of “disaster taxa” dominance after some mass extinction events, and provide a mechanism for the reorganization of ecosystems that is observed after those events. The model makes the testable prediction that dominance by disaster taxa, however, should be observed only when bottom-up disruptions have caused ecosystems to collapse catastrophically.},

Stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and paleontologic investigations of the Red Sandstone Group in the Songwe Basin (a sub-basin of the Rukwa Rift Basin) help clarify the age and depositional history of these strata, which have previously been assigned ages ranging from Middle Jurassic to late Miocene. These seemingly incompatible Mesozoic and Tertiary age assignments for the Red Sandstone Group are, in part, explained by our discovery of two distinct units (Units I and II) that are of different ages but composed of lithologically similar red sandstones and mudstones in the Songwe Basin. Based on distinct, temporally limited vertebrate fossil remains, a Cretaceous age is proposed for Unit I and a Paleogene age for Unit II. The identification of different-aged units in the Songwe Basin suggests a complex structural and stratigraphic history for the Red Sandstone Group in the context of East African Rift evolution.},

	abstract = {In attempting to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of fossil taxa, researchers can use evidence from two sources – morphology and known temporal ranges. For most taxa, the available evidence is stronger for one of these data sources. We examined the limitations of temporal data for reconstructing hominin evolutionary relationships, specifically focusing on the hypothesised ancestor–descendant relationship between Australopithecus sediba and the genus Homo. Some have implied that because the only known specimens of A. sediba are dated to later than the earliest fossils attributed to Homo, the former species is precluded from being ancestral to the latter. However, A. sediba is currently known from one site dated to 1.98 Ma and, thus, its actual temporal range is unknown. Using data from the currently known temporal ranges of fossil hominin species, and incorporating dating error in the analysis, we estimate that the average hominin species’ temporal range is {\textasciitilde}0.97 Myr, which is lower than most figures suggested for mammalian species generally. Using this conservative figure in a thought experiment in which the Malapa specimens are hypothesised to represent the last appearance date, the middle of the temporal range, and first appearance date for the species, the first appearance date of A. sediba would be 2.95, 2.47 and 1.98 Ma, respectively. As these scenarios are all equally plausible, and 2.95 Ma predates the earliest specimens that some have attributed to Homo, we cannot refute the hypothesis that the species A. sediba is ancestral to our genus based solely on currently available temporal data.
\&nbsp;Significance: 

We correct a common misconception in palaeoanthropology that a species currently known only from later in time than another species cannot be ancestral to it.
On temporal grounds alone one cannot dismiss the possibility that A.\&nbsp;sediba could be ancestral to the genus Homo.},

Several methods have been developed to estimate the probability and timing of extinctions from records of such sightings, but they differ in their computational complexity and assumptions about the nature of the sighting record. Here we use simulations to evaluate the performance of seven methods proposed to estimate the upper confidence limit on extinction times under different extinction and sampling scenarios. Our results show that the ability of existing methods to correctly estimate the timing of extinctions varies with the type of extinction (sudden vs. gradual) and the nature of sampling effort over time. When the probability of sampling a species declines over time, many of the methods perform poorly. On the other hand, the simulation results also suggest that as long as the choice of the method is determined by the nature of the underlying sighting data, existing methods should provide reliable inferences about the timing of past extinctions.},

Such factors include the number of available niches in space, productivity, area, species' body size and habitat fragmentation. Here we show that all these patterns can arise from simple constraints on how organisms acquire resources in space. We use spatial scaling laws to describe how species of different sizes find food in patches of varying size and resource concentration. We then derive a mathematical rule for the minimum similarity in size of species that share these resources. This packing rule yields a theory of species diversity that predicts relations between diversity and productivity more effectively thanprevious models. Size and diversity patterns for locally coexisting East African grazing mammals and North American savanna plants strongly support these predictions. The theory also predicts relations between diversity and area and between diversity and habitat fragmentation. Thus, spatial scaling laws provide potentially unifying first principles that may explain many important patterns of species diversity.},

	abstract = {The Oldowan site HWK EE (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) has yielded a large fossil and stone tool assemblage at the transition from Lower to Middle Bed II, ∼1.7 Ma. Integrated tooth wear and stable isotope analyses were performed on the three most abundant ungulate taxa from HWK EE, namely Alcelaphini, cf. Antidorcas recki (Antilopini) and Equus oldowayensis (Equini), to infer dietary traits in each taxon. Some paleodietary changes were observed for cf. A. recki and E. oldowayensis based on tooth wear at the transition from the Lemuta to the Lower Augitic Sandstone (LAS) interval within the HWK EE sequence. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data show no significant changes in bulk diet or hydroclimate between the Lemuta and LAS intervals. The combined tooth wear and stable isotope data suggest similar paleoecological conditions across the two HWK EE intervals, but that differences in vegetation consumed among ungulates may have resulted in changes in dietary niches. Integrating tooth wear and stable isotope analyses permits the characterization of ungulate diets and habitats at HWK EE where C4 dominated and minor mixed C3 and C4 habitats were present. Our results provide a better understanding of the paleoenvironmental conditions of the Lemuta and LAS intervals. The LAS assemblage was mostly accumulated during relatively dry periods at Olduvai Gorge when grasses were not as readily available and grazing animals may have been more nutritionally-stressed than during the formation of the Lemuta assemblage. This helps to contextualize variations in hominin and carnivore feeding behavior observed from the faunal assemblages produced during the two main occupations of the site.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that modern humans evolved in Africa. This consensus has emerged in the last two decades, as molecular evidence has been coupled with findings from paleontology and prehistory. Patterns of DNA variation in living populations, morphology of fossils, and archeological traces can all be read to show that our species has deep roots in Africa and began to disperse into other regions only late in the Pleistocene. There are still questions about the timing of these dispersals and the extent to which modern people replaced or exchanged genes with other, more archaic groups, but new problems are now coming more clearly into focus. These relate to the ancestry of Homo sapiens in the Middle Pleistocene. In this essay, I emphasize the evidence available from Middle Pleistocene localities in Africa and Europe, exploring variation among individuals, composition of hypodigms, species-level taxonomy, and evolutionary relationships of the hominin populations. One obvious difficulty is that the fossils are scarce. For the most part, only incomplete crania are available from African localities. The record is more comprehensive for the Sima de los Huesos in Spain, but principally crania and jaws are known from other European sites. This means that skull traits and measurements must provide the basis for sorting individuals to groups and building differential diagnoses. For much of the material, dating is still poorly controlled, although a few of the most important assemblages can now be placed more securely within a Middle Pleistocene chronological framework. Despite these constraints, it is possible to point toward tentative solutions.},

Failure to distinguish regional influences from local effects has been due, in part, to sampling limitations at small scales, environmental heterogeneity within local or regional samples, and incomplete geographic sampling of species. Here, we use a global dataset comprising 47 forest plots to demonstrate significant region effects on diversity, beyond the influence of local climate, which together explain more than 92\% of the global variation in local forest tree species richness. Significant region effects imply that large-scale processes shaping the regional diversity of forest trees exert influence down to the local scale, where they interact with local processes to determine the number of coexisting species.},

	abstract = {Important changes in the brain have occurred during the course of human evolution. Both absolute and relative size increases can be documented for species of Homo, culminating in the appearance of modern humans. One species that is particularly well-represented by fossil crania is Homo erectus. The mean capacity for 30 individuals is 973 cm3. Within this group there is substantial variation, but brain size increases slightly in specimens from later time periods. Other Middle Pleistocene crania differ from those of Homo erectus. Characters of the facial skeleton, vault, and cranial base suggest that fossils from sites such as Arago Cave in France, the Sima de los Huesos in Spain, Bodo in Ethiopia, Broken Hill in Zambia, and perhaps Dali in China belong to the taxon Homo heidelbergensis. Ten of these mid-Quaternary hominins have brains averaging 1,206 cm3 in volume, and many fall beyond the limits of size predicted for Homo erectus of equivalent age. When orbit height is used to construct an index of relative brain size, it is apparent that the (significant) increase in volume documented for the Middle Pleistocene individuals is not simply a consequence of larger body mass. Encephalization quotient values confirm this finding. These changes in absolute and relative brain size can be taken as further corroborative evidence for a speciation event, in which Homo erectus produced a daughter lineage. It is probable that Homo heidelbergensis originated in Africa or western Eurasia and then ranged widely across the Old World.

	abstract = {How ecological communities react to species extinctions is a long-standing yet current question in ecology. The species constituting the basic units of ecosystems interact with each other forming complex networks of trophic relationships and the characteristics of these networks are highly important for the consequences of species extinction. Here we take a more general approach and analyze a broad range of network characteristics and their role in determining food web susceptibility to secondary extinctions. We extend previous studies, that have focused on the consequences of topological and dynamical food web parameters for food web robustness, by also defining network-wide characteristics depending on the relationships between the distribution of species body masses and other species characteristics. We use a bioenergetic dynamical model to simulate realistically structured model food webs that differ in their structural and dynamical properties as well as their size structure. In order to measure food web robustness we calculated the proportion of species going secondarily extinct. A multiple regression analysis was then used to fit a general model relating the proportion of species going secondarily extinct to the measured food web properties. Our results show that there are multiple factors from all three groups of food web characteristics that affect food web robustness. However, we find the most striking effect was related to the body mass–abundance relationship which points to the importance of body mass relationships for food web stability.
Zusammenfassung
Die Frage nach den Konsequenzen des Artensterbens für ökologische Gemeinschaften ist eine aktuelle Frage, die Ökologen seit langer Zeit beschäftigt. Arten bilden die Grundeinheiten der Ökosysteme: sie interagieren untereinander und bilden dadurch komplexe Netzwerke. Trophische Beziehungen innerhalb dieser Netzwerke und generelle Netzwerkeigenschaften sind entscheidend für die Folgen des Artensterbens. In dieser Studie beschäftigen wir uns mit einem generellen Ansatz, um eine breite Palette von Netzwerkeigenschaften und deren Rolle für sekundäres Artensterben innerhalb von Nahrungsnetzen zu analysieren. Vorherige Studien beschäftigten sich entweder mit topologischen Parametern oder simulierten dynamisch kleinere Nahrungsnetz-Modulen. Unsere Studie kombiniert beide Ansätze und erweitert das Modell um die Abhängigkeit der Parameter von Körpermassen. Wir benutzen dabei ein bioenergetisches Modell und simulieren realistisch strukturierte Nahrungsnetze. Dabei liegt der Fokus auf einer realistischen Körpergrößenverteilung der Arten, sowie auf realistischen Annahmen bezüglich struktureller, dynamischer Aspekte. Die Robustheit der Nahrungsnetze ist zu verstehen als der Anteil der sekundären Aussterbeereignisse, die ausgelöst werden durch das systematische primäre Aussterben. Dabei wird nacheinander jeweils eine Art aus dem Netz entfernt, bis jede Art einmal entfernt wurde. Um den Einfluss einzelner Netzwerkfaktoren auf sekundäres Aussterben zu identifizieren, benutzten wir hier ein multiples Regressionsmodell. Es zeigt sich, dass Faktoren aus drei unterschiedlichen Gruppen (topologisch, dynamisch, allometrisch korreliert) die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen beeinflussen. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Abundanzen und Körpermassen, der die Artgemeinschaften charakterisiert, zeigte interessanterweise den stärksten Effekt auf die sekundäre Aussterberate.},

A growing body of research describes analogous intraspecific variation and its potential importance for population dynamics and community outcomes. However, the magnitude of intraspecific variation relative to interspecific variation in key dimensions of consumer-resource interactions remains unknown, hampering our understanding of the importance of this variation for population and community processes. In this study, we examine feeding preference through repeated laboratory choice feeding assays of 444 wild-caught individuals of eight invertebrate grazer species on rocky reefs in northern California. Between-species variation accounted for 25\%–33\% of the total variation in preference for the preferred resource, while between-individual variation accounted for 4\%–5\% of total variation. For two of the eight species, between-individual variation was significantly different from zero and on average contributed 14\% and 17\% of the total diet variation, even after accounting for differences due to size and sex. Therefore, even with clearly distinguishable between-species differences in mean preference, diet variation between and within individuals can contribute to the dietary niche width of species and guilds, which may be overlooked by focusing solely on species’ mean resource use patterns.},

	abstract = {The species richness (diversity) of local plant and animal assemblages--biological communities--balances regional processes of species formation and geographic dispersal, which add species to communities, against local processes of predation, competitive exclusion, adaptation, and stochastic variation, which may promote local extinction. During the past three decades, ecologists have sought to explain differences in local diversity by the influence of the physical environment on local interactions among species, interactions that are generally believed to limit the number of coexisting species. But diversity of the biological community often fails to converge under similar physical conditions, and local diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon regional diversity. These observations suggest that regional and historical processes, as well as unique events and circumstances, profoundly influence local community structure. Ecologists must broaden their concepts of community processes and incorporate data from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of community theory.},

	abstract = {Species selection, differential rates of speciation or extension resulting from species level characters, is often invoked as the main mechanism of macroevolution that is not simply an extension of microevolutionary processes. So long as we are careful in defining “species”, the logic of species selection is sound. This does not mean, however, that this process can influence evolutionary dynamics under realistic conditions. The principal challenge to the efficacy of species selection as an evolutionary mechanism is the idea that selection between individuals within species will be so much more efficient as to swamp out any effects of selection between species. To assess this, a genetic model is constructed that include simultaneous selection within and between species, and this is used to ask: under what conditions could species selection influence evolutionary dynamics, even in the face of opposing selection between individuals? The model shows that the efficacy of species selection is strongly determined by the time between speciation events (measured in individual generations), the mutation rate of the character under consideration, and the initial size of a newly formed reproductively isolated population. Data indicate that a few studied lineages have shown sufficiently high speciation rates to make species selection an important mechanism in the evolution of characters with mutation rates on the order of 10−6per generation. Quantitative characters, such as body size, generally change too readily for species selection to be relevant to their evolution. Complex characters, however, may be good candidates to be influenced by species selection. The interaction of selection within and between species can be subtle, with individual selection looking, from the standpoint of a species, very much like development of an individual. Furthermore, selection between individuals may be the main process assembling complex adaptations, while species selection allows them to persist over long periods of time.},

To gain new insights, we constructed a spatially explicit community model wherein we controlled dispersal distances, the strength of habitat filtering, and the grain of habitat heterogeneity to study the distance decay of several (dis)similarity indices. The impact of habitat filtering is dependent on the ratio between the grain of habitats and the mean dispersal distance. The behavior of (dis)similarity indices varies. First, incidence-based measures of species overlap are less affected by habitat filtering than are abundance-based indices. Second, species identity-based indices, derived from population genetics' F(ST), show interesting capacities to infer dispersal processes under neutrality but are also highly sensitive to habitat filtering. All indices except F(ST)-related indices under neutrality are very sensitive to overall species richness. Hence, community patterns showing contrasted diversity levels should be compared with caution. Partitioning similarity indices within and between habitats appears to be an efficient approach to assess the strength of habitat filtering, and we show that a torus-translation test is powerful for this purpose. We finally highlight the need for further analytical studies to achieve theoretical expectations of similarity decay under dispersal and niche processes.},

explored potential explanatory factors (paleoenvironmental proxies) and

Eradication is commonly declared either on an ad hoc basis, on notions of seed bank longevity, or on setting arbitrary thresholds of 1\% or 5\% confidence that the species is not present. Rather than declaring eradication at some arbitrary level of confidence, we take an economic approach in which we stop looking when the expected costs outweigh the expected benefits. We develop theory that determines the number of years of absent surveys required to minimize the net expected cost. Given detection of a species is imperfect, the optimal stopping time is a trade-off between the cost of continued surveying and the cost of escape and damage if eradication is declared too soon. A simple rule of thumb compares well to the exact optimal solution using stochastic dynamic programming. Application of the approach to the eradication programme of Helenium amarum reveals that the actual stopping time was a precautionary one given the ranges for each parameter.},

	abstract = {Aim A raw count of the species encountered across surveys usually underestimates species richness. Statistical estimators are often less biased. Nonparametric estimators of species richness are widely considered the least biased, but no particular estimator has consistently performed best. This is partly a function of estimators responding differently to assemblage-level factors and survey design parameters. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of raw counts and nonparametric estimators of species richness across various assemblages and with different survey designs. Location We used both simulated and published field data. Methods We evaluated the bias, precision and accuracy of raw counts and 13 nonparametric estimators using simulations that systematically varied assemblage characteristics (number of species, species abundance distribution, total number of individuals, spatial configuration of individuals and species detection probability), sampling effort and survey design. Results informed the development of an estimator selection framework that we evaluated with field data. Results When averaged across assemblages, most nonparametric estimators were less negatively biased than a raw count. Estimators based on the similarity of repeated subsets of surveys were most accurate and their accumulation curves appeared to reach asymptotes fastest. Number of species, species abundance distribution and effort had the largest effects on performance, ultimately by affecting the proportion of the species pool contained in a sample. Our estimator selection framework showed promising results when applied to field data. Main conclusions A raw count of the number of species in an area is far from the best estimate of true species richness. Nonparametric estimators are less biased. Newer largely unused, estimators perform better than more well known and longer established counterparts under certain conditions. Given that there is generally a trade-off between bias and precision, we believe that estimator variance, which is often not reported when presenting species richness estimates, should always be included.},

	abstract = {Ecological specialization provides information about adaptations of species to their environment. However, identification of traits representing the relevant dimensions of ecological space remains challenging. Here we endeavoured to explain how complex habitat specializations relate to various ecological traits of European birds. We employed phylogenetic generalized least squares and information theoretic approach statistically controlling for differences in geographic range size among species. Habitat specialists had narrower diet niche, wider climatic niche, higher wing length / tail length ratio and migrated on smaller distances than habitat generalists. Our results support an expected positive link between habitat and diet niche breadth estimates, however a negative relationship between habitat and climate niche breadths is surprising. It implies that habitat specialists occur mostly in spatially restricted environments with high climatic variability such as mountain areas. This, however, complicates our understanding of predicted impacts of climatic changes on avian geographical distributions. Our results further corroborate that habitat specialization reflects occupation of morphological space, when specialists depend more on manoeuvrability of the flight and are thus more closely associated to open habitats than habitat generalists. Finally, our results indicate that long distance movements might hamper narrow habitat preferences. In conclusion, we have shown that species’ distributions across habitats are informative about their positions along other axes of ecological space and can explain states of particular functional traits, however, our results also reveal that the links between different niche estimates cannot be always straightforwardly predicted.

	abstract = {One of the best-recognized patterns in the evolution of organismal size is the tendency for mean and maximum size within a clade to decrease following a major extinction event and to increase during the subsequent recovery interval. Because larger organisms are typically thought to be at higher extinction risk than their smaller relatives, it has commonly been assumed that size reduction mostly reflects the selective extinction of larger species. However, to our knowledge the relative importance of within- and among-lineage processes in driving overall trends in body size has never been compared quantitatively. In this study, we use a global, specimen-level database of foraminifera to study size evolution from the Late Permian through Late Triassic. We explicitly decompose size evolution into within- and among-genus components. We find that size reduction following the end-Permian mass extinction was driven more by size reduction within surviving species and genera than by the selective extinction of larger taxa. Similarly, we find that increase in mean size across taxa during Early Triassic biotic recovery was a product primarily of size increase within survivors and the extinction of unusually small taxa, rather than the origination of new, larger taxa. During background intervals we find no strong or consistent tendency for extinction, origination, or within-lineage change to move the overall size distribution toward larger or smaller sizes. Thus, size stasis during background intervals appears to result from small and inconsistent effects of within- and among-lineage processes rather than from large but offsetting effects of within- and among-taxon components. These observations are compatible with existing data for other taxa and extinction events, implying that mass extinctions do not influence size evolution by simply selecting against larger organisms. Instead, they appear to create conditions favorable to smaller organisms.},

	abstract = {It is suggested that joint architecture of the extant cercopithecid forelimb differentiates terrestrial from arboreal quadrupedal species. Linear dimensions of forelimb joint morphology have also been used to assign fossil species to locomotor categories. However, many primates use a mix of terrestrial and arboreal behaviors, which can be problematic when developing models of behavior reconstruction using morphological variation. The current study uses multivariate analyses to identify morphology related to substrate use in primates, including determination of semiterrestriality. Measurements collected from distal humeri and proximal ulnae of 49 extant cercopithecid primate species were selected based on studies indicating that they could individually predict substrate use. Analyses including one-way analysis of variance, principal components, and discriminant functions were conducted to assess their ability to differentiate between arboreal and terrestrial substrate use. The functions created in these analyses are then applied to data from fossil specimens from the Hadar sequence, Ethiopia, sampling both the Hadar and overlying Busidima Formations, to retrodict possible substrate behavior of fossil monkeys at Hadar through time. As this study is designed to identify function and behavior rather than phylogeny, the taxonomic assignment of the fossil specimens is sometimes uncertain, but substrate behavior can still be inferred. Results suggest that substrate use, including semiterrestrial behavior, in extant and extinct primates can be inferred successfully from multivariate analyses based on joint morphology of the monkey elbow. This study reveals that the ecological distribution of primarily terrestrial fossil primate species of the Hadar sequence is comparable to modern-day communities in habitats similar to those reconstructed for the Hadar members.},

The frequency distribution of durations is highly skewed; short-lived taxa are far more common than long-lived taxa. Since many short duration species are not preserved, the actual mean duration is probably considerably shorter than the measured estimates. As Van Valen (13) and others have shown, the extinction of species is often rather similar to the decay of radioactive isotopes; that is, the proportion of species that become extinct in successive time intervals of equal length is essentially constant. Major exceptions to this pattern occur as a consequence of mass extinction events.},

Here, we use ecologically relevant measures of cognitive ability, the reported incidence of behavioral innovation, social learning, and tool use, to show that brain size and cognitive capacity are indeed correlated. A comparative analysis of 533 instances of innovation, 445 observations of social learning, and 607 episodes of tool use established that social learning, innovation, and tool use frequencies are positively correlated with species' relative and absolute “executive” brain volumes, after controlling for phylogeny and research effort. Moreover, innovation and social learning frequencies covary across species, in conflict with the view that there is an evolutionary tradeoff between reliance on individual experience and social cues. These findings provide an empirical link between behavioral innovation, social learning capacities, and brain size in mammals. The ability to learn from others, invent new behaviors, and use tools may have played pivotal roles in primate brain evolution.},

The same method can be used in studies of diversity at higher taxonomic levels (families and orders) in the fossil record where samples represent world-wide distributions of species or genera over long periods of geologic time. Application of rarefaction to several large samples of post-Paleozoic echinoids (totaling 7.911 species) confirms the utility of the method. Rarefaction shows that the observed increase in the number of echinoid families since the Paleozoic is real in the sense that it cannot be explained solely by the increase in numbers of preserved species. There has been no statistically significant increase in the number of families since mid-Cretaceous, however. At the order level, echinoid diversity may have been nearly constant since late Triassic or early Jurassic.},

	abstract = {Two separate subfamilies of Plio-Pleistocene African pigs (suids) consecutively evolved hypsodont and horizodont molars with flat occlusal surfaces, commonly interpreted as an adaptive trait to a grazing diet, similar to that of the present warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.). To investigate this in detail, we studied the 3D-dental topography of fossil specimens from the Turkana Basin, using geographic information systems-based methods. To establish baselines for interpretation of the Turkana Basin suids, topography of third molars of extant suids with known diets were analyzed: grazing warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), herbivorous mixed-feeder forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), omnivorous generalist wild boar (Sus scrofa), omnivorous fruit and tuber eater bush pig (Potamochoerus spp.), and omnivorous fruit eater babirusa (Babyrousa spp.) In addition, we analyzed supposedly browsing Miocene suids, Listriodon spp. The same topographic measures were applied to Plio-Pleistocene specimens from the Turkana Basin, Kenya: Notochoerus euilus, Notochoerus scotti, Kolpochoerus heseloni, and Metridiochoerus andrewsi. With some differences between techniques, 3D-dental topography analysis of extant suid molars mostly predicts the dietary differences between the species correctly. The grazing P. africanus differs from both the omnivorous suids and the herbivorous mixed-feeder H. meinertzhageni in all except one metrics. The omnivorous mostly tropical suids, Potamochoerus and Babyrousa, primarily differ from the generalist, S. scrofa, in the orientation patch count analysis, showing higher occlusal complexity in the latter. Although, there might be significant gaps between the morphological changes and the ecological changes, we conclude that based on comparison of dental topography with the present-day suids, N. scotti and M. andrewsi were most likely highly specialized grazers, while N. euilus and K. heseloni retained more of their ancestral, omnivorous heritage, but consumed grasses more than the extant omnivorous suids. Research highlights Dental topography can predict different diets in present-day wild pigs. The Plio-Pleistocene pigs in the Turkana Basin had dental topography mostly similar to extant grazing warthog, although some species also had resemblances to omnivorous forest pigs.},

	abstract = {Aim To assess the geographical transferability of niche-based species distribution models fitted with two modelling techniques. Location Two distinct geographical study areas in Switzerland and Austria, in the subalpine and alpine belts. Methods Generalized linear and generalized additive models (GLM and GAM) with a binomial probability distribution and a logit link were fitted for 54 plant species, based on topoclimatic predictor variables. These models were then evaluated quantitatively and used for spatially explicit predictions within (internal evaluation and prediction) and between (external evaluation and prediction) the two regions. Comparisons of evaluations and spatial predictions between regions and models were conducted in order to test if species and methods meet the criteria of full transferability. By full transferability, we mean that: (1) the internal evaluation of models fitted in region A and B must be similar; (2) a model fitted in region A must at least retain a comparable external evaluation when projected into region B, and vice-versa; and (3) internal and external spatial predictions have to match within both regions. Results The measures of model fit are, on average, 24\% higher for GAMs than for GLMs in both regions. However, the differences between internal and external evaluations (AUC coefficient) are also higher for GAMs than for GLMs (a difference of 30\% for models fitted in Switzerland and 54\% for models fitted in Austria). Transferability, as measured with the AUC evaluation, fails for 68\% of the species in Switzerland and 55\% in Austria for GLMs (respectively for 67\% and 53\% of the species for GAMs). For both GAMs and GLMs, the agreement between internal and external predictions is rather weak on average (Kulczynski's coefficient in the range 0.3–0.4), but varies widely among individual species. The dominant pattern is an asymmetrical transferability between the two study regions (a mean decrease of 20\% for the AUC coefficient when the models are transferred from Switzerland and 13\% when they are transferred from Austria). Main conclusions The large inter-specific variability observed among the 54 study species underlines the need to consider more than a few species to test properly the transferability of species distribution models. The pronounced asymmetry in transferability between the two study regions may be due to peculiarities of these regions, such as differences in the ranges of environmental predictors or the varied impact of land-use history, or to species-specific reasons like differential phenotypic plasticity, existence of ecotypes or varied dependence on biotic interactions that are not properly incorporated into niche-based models. The lower variation between internal and external evaluation of GLMs compared to GAMs further suggests that overfitting may reduce transferability. Overall, a limited geographical transferability calls for caution when projecting niche-based models for assessing the fate of species in future environments.},

The facts that the world's oceans are larger, continuous and three-dimensional, with fewer evident geographical barriers than there are on land, explain why marine biogeographical regions are less well-defined and geographical ranges of marine taxa more wide-spread. This generalization has, however, been questioned following recent findings of extremely rich and highly endemic benthic faunas.

	abstract = {Because most macroecological and biodiversity data are spatially autocorrelated, special tools for describing spatial structures and dealing with hypothesis testing are usually required. Unfortunately, most of these methods have not been available in a single statistical package. Consequently, using these tools is still a challenge for most ecologists and biogeographers. In this paper, we present sam (Spatial Analysis in Macroecology), a new, easy-to-use, freeware package for spatial analysis in macroecology and biogeography. Through an intuitive, fully graphical interface, this package allows the user to describe spatial patterns in variables and provides an explicit spatial framework for standard techniques of regression and correlation. Moran's I autocorrelation coefficient can be calculated based on a range of matrices describing spatial relationships, for original variables as well as for residuals of regression models, which can also include filtering components (obtained by standard trend surface analysis or by principal coordinates of neighbour matrices). sam also offers tools for correcting the number of degrees of freedom when calculating the significance of correlation coefficients. Explicit spatial modelling using several forms of autoregression and generalized least-squares models are also available. We believe this new tool will provide researchers with the basic statistical tools to resolve autocorrelation problems and, simultaneously, to explore spatial components in macroecological and biogeographical data. Although the program was designed primarily for the applications in macroecology and biogeography, most of sam's statistical tools will be useful for all kinds of surface pattern spatial analysis.

Competing hypotheses have typically been evaluated with correlative models that do not explicitly incorporate the mechanisms responsible for biotic diversity gradients. Here, we employ a fundamentally different approach that uses spatially explicit Monte Carlo models of the placement of cohesive geographical ranges in an environmentally heterogeneous landscape. These models predict species richness of endemic South American birds (2248 species) measured at a continental scale. We demonstrate that the principal single-factor and composite (species-energy, water-energy and temperature-kinetics) models proposed thus far fail to predict (r2⩽0.05) the richness of species with small to moderately large geographical ranges (first three range-size quartiles). These species constitute the bulk of the avifauna and are primary targets for conservation. Climate-driven models performed reasonably well only for species with the largest geographical ranges (fourth quartile) when range cohesion was enforced. Our analyses suggest that present models inadequately explain the extraordinary diversity of avian species in the montane tropics, the most species-rich region on Earth. Our findings imply that correlative climatic models substantially underestimate the importance of historical factors and small-scale niche-driven assembly processes in shaping contemporary species-richness patterns.},

	abstract = {Predicting abundance across a species' distribution is useful for studies of ecology and biodiversity management. Modeling of survey data in relation to environmental variables can be a powerful method for extrapolating abundances across a species' distribution and, consequently, calculating total abundances and ultimately trends. Research in this area has demonstrated that models of abundance are often unstable and produce spurious estimates, and until recently our ability to remove detection error limited the development of accurate models. The N-mixture model accounts for detection and abundance simultaneously and has been a significant advance in abundance modeling. Case studies that have tested these new models have demonstrated success for some species, but doubt remains over the appropriateness of standard N-mixture models for many species. Here we develop the N-mixture model to accommodate zero-inflated data, a common occurrence in ecology, by employing zero-inflated count models. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this method to modeling count data. We use four variants of the N-mixture model (Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial) to model abundance, occupancy (zero-inflated models only) and detection probability of six birds in South Australia. We assess models by their statistical fit and the ecological realism of the parameter estimates. Specifically, we assess the statistical fit with AIC and assess the ecological realism by comparing the parameter estimates with expected values derived from literature, ecological theory, and expert opinion. We demonstrate that, despite being frequently ranked the “best model” according to AIC, the negative binomial variants of the N-mixture often produce ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates. The zero-inflated Poisson variant is preferable to the negative binomial variants of the N-mixture, as it models an ecological mechanism rather than a statistical phenomenon and generates reasonable parameter estimates. Our results emphasize the need to include ecological reasoning when choosing appropriate models and highlight the dangers of modeling statistical properties of the data. We demonstrate that, to obtain ecologically realistic estimates of abundance, occupancy and detection probability, it is essential to understand the sources of variation in the data and then use this information to choose appropriate error distributions.},

	abstract = {Inference and estimates of abundance are critical for quantifying population dynamics and impacts of environmental change. Yet imperfect detection and other phenomena that cause zero inflation can induce estimation error and obscure ecological patterns. Recent statistical advances provide an increasingly diverse array of analytical approaches for estimating population size to address these phenomena. We examine how detection error and zero inflation in count data inform the choice of analytical method for estimating population size of unmarked individuals that are not uniquely identified. We review two established (GLMs and distance sampling) and nine emerging methods that use N-mixture models (Royle–Nichols model, and basic, zero inflated, temporary emigration, beta-binomial, generalized open-population, spatially explicit, single visit and multispecies) to estimate abundance of unmarked populations, focusing on their requirements and how each method accounts for imperfect detection and zero inflation. Eight of the emerging methods can account for both imperfect detection and additional variation in population size in the forms of non-occupancy, temporary emigration, correlated detection and population dynamics. Methods differ in sampling design requirements (e.g. count vs. detection/non-detection data, single vs. multiple visits, covariate data), and their suitability for a particular study will depend on the characteristics of the study species, scale and objectives of the study, and financial and logistical considerations. Most emerging methods were developed over the past decade, so their efficacy is still under study, and additional statistical advances are likely to occur.},

	abstract = {Overdispersion is a common feature of models of biological data, but researchers often fail to model the excess variation driving the overdispersion, resulting in biased parameter estimates and standard errors. Quantifying and modeling overdispersion when it is present is therefore critical for robust biological inference. One means to account for overdispersion is to add an observation-level random effect (OLRE) to a model, where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that can absorb the extra-parametric variation in the data. Although some studies have investigated the utility of OLRE to model overdispersion in Poisson count data, studies doing so for Binomial proportion data are scarce. Here I use a simulation approach to investigate the ability of both OLRE models and Beta-Binomial models to recover unbiased parameter estimates in mixed effects models of Binomial data under various degrees of overdispersion. In addition, as ecologists often fit random intercept terms to models when the random effect sample size is low ({\textless}5 levels), I investigate the performance of both model types under a range of random effect sample sizes when overdispersion is present. Simulation results revealed that the efficacy of OLRE depends on the process that generated the overdispersion; OLRE failed to cope with overdispersion generated from a Beta-Binomial mixture model, leading to biased slope and intercept estimates, but performed well for overdispersion generated by adding random noise to the linear predictor. Comparison of parameter estimates from an OLRE model with those from its corresponding Beta-Binomial model readily identified when OLRE were performing poorly due to disagreement between effect sizes, and this strategy should be employed whenever OLRE are used for Binomial data to assess their reliability. Beta-Binomial models performed well across all contexts, but showed a tendency to underestimate effect sizes when modelling non-Beta-Binomial data. Finally, both OLRE and Beta-Binomial models performed poorly when models contained {\textless}5 levels of the random intercept term, especially for estimating variance components, and this effect appeared independent of total sample size. These results suggest that OLRE are a useful tool for modelling overdispersion in Binomial data, but that they do not perform well in all circumstances and researchers should take care to verify the robustness of parameter estimates of OLRE models.},

The second, more rapid phase began during human population growth and early agricultural intensification ({\textasciitilde}2,000–1,000 ybp).

	abstract = {Achieving food security in particular in Africa continues to pose a major challenge to humankind. It is clear that the future agricultural potential of Africa plays a critical role in meeting this challenge. Although crop yield can be estimated with a degree of reliability using a limited sample of ground observations, the exact crop acreage and the spatial distribution are rarely available. Even though remote sensing offers the ability to produce a rapid and up-to-date land use and land cover database for agricultural monitoring, there are only a few countries in Africa where higher resolution satellite data such as Landsat have been used for land cover map production at the national level. However a number of global products have been produced which contain information on cropland extent. This paper will outline a comparison of four sources of land cover data to determine which product is the most suitable for agricultural monitoring and for the subsequent development of a crop mask. The land cover products used are the Global Land Cover Map (GLC-2000), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product (MOD12V1), the SAGE (Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment) and the AFRICOVER dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Both the GLC-2000 and MODIS land cover products are at a resolution of 1 km2 while AFRICOVER, based on visual interpretation of 30-m resolution Landsat images, is available at a much finer resolution. The four land cover products are first aggregated to the same resolution so that they can be compared. The legend categories of the four land cover products in this study are reconciled using the method developed in Fritz and See [Fritz, S. and See, L., 2005, Comparison of land cover maps using fuzzy agreement. International Journal of Geographic Information Science, 19, pp. 787–807.] and See and Fritz [See, L.M. and Fritz, S., 2005, A user-defined fuzzy logic approach to comparing global land cover products. In 14th European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative Geography, 9–12 September 2005, Lisbon, Portugal.] that allows overlap between legend definitions to be taken into account. Once the legend definitions between the different land cover products are reconciled, the maps are then compared with national and sub-national statistics. Analysis is undertaken at both continental and national scales as well as sub-national for Sudan and Eritrea. The study generally concludes that MODIS has the tendency to underestimate cropland cover when compared with FAO statistics or AFRICOVER data, whereas GLC-2000 tends to overestimate cropland cover in those countries that are located at the northern transition zone of subtropical shrubland and semi-desert areas. In this area MODIS and SAGE show a relatively similar cropland distribution. Even though the SAGE database has been calibrated with national statistics, it does not perform better than the other two datasets overall, and has highlighted the fact that the SAGE data show regional weaknesses and should be replaced in certain regions by more recent datasets such as GLC-2000 and MODIS, or ideally by a hybrid product that combines the best of the three products, depending upon the region and country.},

The diets of terrestrial carnivorous mammals, defined here as species primarily consuming other mammals (hereafter, mammal-consumers), have been extensively studied and can vary in the proportion of different food types, and species, consumed across their geographic ranges. Accessibility to data capturing such variation in diets of mammal-consumers across the variety of ecosystems they occur in would provide valuable information for conservation, and open research avenues for macroevolution and macroecology.

Here, we present CarniDIET (version 1.0), an open-access database containing quantitative data on the diets of terrestrial mammal-consumers collated from the literature. Main types of variable contained Diet records capturing the percentage of mammalian prey, to the highest taxonomic resolution available, and non-mammalian food types (e.g., birds, invertebrates) in the diets of mammal-consumers at specific sites and times.

Since the late Pliocene, coastal archaeological sites have formed within the lacustrine dynamics. Here, lake levels are reconstructed from 2.4 to 1.7 Ma using sedimentary facies and water/depth-controlled sediment association. The lacustrine stratigraphy is measured with a total station, and cyclostratigraphy is derived from tephrochronology. The water depths are evaluated from paleochemical properties of lake sediments analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our reconstruction highlights that Lake Turkana rose during 100 ka insolation/eccentricity maxima periods in response to higher monsoonal inputs of the Omo River. However, Lake Turkana also expanded through an insolation minimum at 2.17–1.95 Ma. This asynchronous lake phase coincides with volcanic closure of the Omo River and Lake Turkana outflow sill to the east and the Indian Ocean. An archaeological hiatus occurs during this endorheic lake phase, and alkalinity increases at the beginning of the hiatus. The lake rose again during insolation/eccentricity maxima at 1.9–1.7 Ma, and a new outflow sill opened to the west and the Nile basin. Hominin coastal occupations return during this exorheic/freshwater lake phase.},

	abstract = {Within ancient ecosystems, it is generally difficult to determine the specific diets of species from higher trophic levels, which in turn hinders our understanding of trophic relationships and energy flow through these systems. To better understand the ecology of taxa at higher trophic levels, we used analysis of tooth enamel stable carbon isotope values to infer the dietary preferences of Canis edwardii and Smilodon gracilis from the Leisey Shell Pit 1A (LSP 1A) and Inglis 1A, two Pleistocene localities in Florida. The goals of the analyses were to (1) determine whether these carnivorans specialized in particular prey types or maintained a generalist diet; (2) ascertain whether carbon isotope values support what was previously suggested about the ecology of these species; and (3) establish what ecological details of ancient food webs can be discovered by carbon isotope analyses at higher trophic levels. Results show that the sampled carnivoran carbon isotope values are distributed among suspected prey isotope values, suggesting that varied prey were taken at the study localities. Prey compositions were modeled for each carnivoran species by using Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR). The modeled diets indicate that each studied carnivoran had a generalist diet; however, there are differences in how these taxa achieved dietary generalization. At the glacial Inglis 1A locality, sampled individuals of C. edwardii and S. gracilis show similar isotope values and modeled dietary prey proportions, although both carnivorans do show a preference for grazing prey species. The similar isotopic values, and calculated prey proportions, observed between these species may imply greater interspecific competition for food. At the interglacial LSP 1A locality, C. edwardii shows values similar to those observed at Inglis 1A. In contrast, the data for S. gracilis shows a preference for consuming browsing prey species. Further, its restricted range of carbon isotope values suggests that S. gracilis may have concentrated its feeding within a particular habitat. Examination of stable carbon isotope values among species at higher trophic levels reveals that some intricacies of ancient food webs can be discerned.},

We used webcams sited at waterholes in South Africa's Kruger and Pilanesberg, Madikwe Game Reserve and Tembe Elephant Park, and Botswana's Mashatu Game Reserve to remotely monitor waterhole use at random times throughout the day. Over the 16-month study period, 1546 observations were made of 30 species at waterholes, with elephants (Loxodonta africana) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) being the most frequently observed species. There was a high degree of diurnal overlap in waterhole use amongst the herbivores, but they partitioned the time of peak waterhole use. Large predators were largely nocturnal while their prey was invariably diurnal. The index of relative water use showed that hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) were highly water-dependent, whereas lion (Panthera leo), spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) appear relatively water independent. African fauna may partition waterhole use to avoid competition and predation. The use of webcams is a novel technique to allow remote monitoring of aspects of the ecology of African wildlife at minimal cost.},

	abstract = {Predator-prey body mass relationships are a vital part of food webs across ecosystems and provide key information for predicting the susceptibility of carnivore populations to extinction. Despite this, there has been limited research on the minimum and maximum prey size of mammalian carnivores. Without information on large-scale patterns of prey mass, we limit our understanding of predation pressure, trophic cascades and susceptibility of carnivores to decreasing prey populations. The majority of studies that examine predator-prey body mass relationships focus on either a single or a subset of mammalian species, which limits the strength of our models as well as their broader application. We examine the relationship between predator body mass and the minimum, maximum and range of their prey's body mass across 108 mammalian carnivores, from weasels to baleen whales (Carnivora and Cetacea). We test whether mammals show a positive relationship between prey and predator body mass, as in reptiles and birds, as well as examine how environment (aquatic and terrestrial) and phylogenetic relatedness play a role in this relationship. We found that phylogenetic relatedness is a strong driver of predator-prey mass patterns in carnivorous mammals and accounts for a higher proportion of variance compared with the biological drivers of body mass and environment. We show a positive predator-prey body mass pattern for terrestrial mammals as found in reptiles and birds, but no relationship for aquatic mammals. Our results will benefit our understanding of trophic interactions, the susceptibility of carnivores to population declines and the role of carnivores within ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Predator–prey relationships and trophic levels are indicators of community structure, and are important for monitoring ecosystem changes. Mammals colonized the marine environment on seven separate occasions, which resulted in differences in species' physiology, morphology and behaviour. It is likely that these changes have had a major effect upon predator–prey relationships and trophic position; however, the effect of environment is yet to be clarified. We compiled a dataset, based on the literature, to explore the relationship between body mass, trophic level and predator–prey ratio across terrestrial (n = 51) and marine (n = 56) mammals. We did not find the expected positive relationship between trophic level and body mass, but we did find that marine carnivores sit 1.3 trophic levels higher than terrestrial carnivores. Also, marine mammals are largely carnivorous and have significantly larger predator–prey ratios compared with their terrestrial counterparts. We propose that primary productivity, and its availability, is important for mammalian trophic structure and body size. Also, energy flow and community structure in the marine environment are influenced by differences in energy efficiency and increased food web stability. Enhancing our knowledge of feeding ecology in mammals has the potential to provide insights into the structure and functioning of marine and terrestrial communities.},

	abstract = {Climate is thought to play a critical role in human evolution; however, this hypothesis is difficult to test due to a lack of long, high-quality paleoclimate records from key hominin fossil locales. To address this issue, we analyzed organic geochemical indicators of climate in a drill core from West Turkana, Kenya that spans ∼1.9–1.4 Ma, an interval that includes several important hominin evolutionary transitions. We analyzed the hydrogen isotopic composition of terrestrial plant waxes (δDwax) to reconstruct orbital-timescale changes in regional hydrology and their relationship with global climate forcings and the hominin fossil record. Our data indicate little change in the long-term mean hydroclimate during this interval, in contrast to inferred changes in the level of Lake Turkana, suggesting that lake level may be responding dominantly to deltaic progradation or tectonically-driven changes in basin configuration as opposed to hydroclimate. Time-series spectral analyses of the isotopic data reveal strong precession-band (21 kyr) periodicity, indicating that regional hydroclimate was strongly affected by changes in insolation. We observe an interval of particularly high-amplitude hydrologic variation at ∼1.7 Ma, which occurs during a time of high orbital eccentricity hence large changes in processionally-driven insolation amplitude. This interval overlaps with multiple hominin species turnovers, the appearance of new stone tool technology, and hominin dispersal out of Africa, supporting the notion that climate variability played an important role in hominin evolution.},

Yet conservation managers have no way of knowing the carrying capacity of their reserves. Here we derived relationships between the preferred prey (species and weight range) of Africa’s large predator guild and their population densities to predict their carrying capacity in ten South African conservation areas. Conservation managers intervened at several of these sites because of evidence of predator overpopulation and these provided independent tests of our predictions. Highly significant linear relationships were found between the biomass of the preferred prey species of lion, leopard, spotted hyaena and African wild dog, and the biomass of prey in the preferred weight range of cheetah. These relationships are more robust than previous work for lion, cheetah and leopard, and novel for spotted hyaena and African wild dog. These relationships predicted that several predators exceeded carrying capacity at four sites, two where managers expressed concerns about overpopulation due to a decline in wildlife abundance and two where carnivores were actively removed. The ability to predict the carrying capacity of large predators is fundamental to their conservation, particularly in small enclosed reserves. Every predator that preys on large, readily surveyed wildlife can have its carrying capacity predicted in this manner based on the abundance of its preferred prey. This will be beneficial for reintroduction attempts, threatened species management, overpopulation estimation, detecting poaching and in investigating intra-guild competition.},

	abstract = {Apex predators are often threatened with extinction, and reintroduction is one method conservation managers are using to secure their persistence. Yet the ability to predict what these predators will eat upon reintroduction is lacking. Here we test predictions of the diet of the lion (Panthera leo), derived from dietary electivity index and optimality theory, using independent data collected from reintroduced and resident populations. We solved the Jacobs' index preference equation for each prey species of the lion using values calculated by Hayward and Kerley (2005) and prey abundance data from 4 reintroduction sites and one resident lion population over several years. We then compared these estimates with actual kill data gathered from each site and time period, using the log-likelihood ratio and linear regression. The model precisely predicted the observed number of kills in 9 of the 13 tests. There was a highly significant linear relationship between the number of lion kills predicted to occur at a site and the number observed for all but one site (x̄ r2 = 0.612; β = 1.03). Predicting predator diet will allow conservation managers to stop responding and start planning in advance for reintroductions and environmental variation. Furthermore, ensuring that sufficient food resources are available is likely to increase the success of reintroduction projects. In addition, managers responsible for threatened prey species will be able to predict the vulnerability of these species to predation in the event of predator reintroductions or changes in abundance. These methods are applicable to virtually all large predators that have been sufficiently studied.},

This is one of the first attempts at an integrated understanding of the suite of ecological and behavioural factors that influence hunting decisions in a large carnivore. The decision of a cheetah to hunt or not was influenced by the abundance of their main prey, the reproductive status of the cheetah and the presence of competitors and predators, but not by the hunger level of the cheetah. Given that the decision to hunt is taken, prey choice is then driven by the time of year, the sex of the predator, the abundance of prey and the presence of competitors. We believe that discrete choice models may provide a new step forward in our ability to understand the decisions that animals make in their natural environment.},

	abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi-species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},

We identified small mammal craniodental elements from each pellet and tested for differences among small mammal assemblages for each raptor species and study site. We found that reconstructed avian predator diets clustered significantly by site but not by predator species. Bray-Curtis diet dissimilarities were also significantly lower when comparing different raptor species within a site than when comparing the same raptor species across different sites. Our results suggest that raptors choose to eat a diversity of small mammal species close to their roosts rather than fly long distances to specialize on a particular prey species. Neontologists and paleoecologists alike can therefore be confident that raptor pellets faithfully represent local small mammal diversity.},

We find concentrations of rarity, in excess of what is predicted by a null expectation, near the coasts and at higher latitudes. We also observe mismatches between these rarity hotspots and marine protected areas. This pattern is repeated for both major groupings of fish, the Actinopterygii (bony fish) and Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates and rays).

Vrba’s resource-use hypothesis suggests that speciation in biomes subjected to successive expansion-contraction-fragmentation during periods of climatic change generates high frequency of species restricted to a single biome (stenobiomic species). We compiled biome occupation for all terrestrial mammals and, using Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrated that patterns of biome occupation are congruent with those predicted by the resource-use hypothesis. Biome specialists are much more speciose than expected by chance, while there are fewer moderate biome generalists than expected. Despite their scarcity, extreme eurybiomic lineages show significant overrepresentation, which suggests they are seldom affected by climate-related extinction processes. Additionally, stenobiomic species are concentrated in biomes placed at the extremes of the climatic gradient, such as equatorial rainforest, subtropical desert, steppe, and tundra. Although this pattern is fairly maintained across different mammalian families, highlighting its universality, our analysis also found great variability. Exceptions to the predictions of the resource-use hypothesis seem to be associated to biome climatic or geographical heterogeneity, which favours vicariance in some biomes not placed in extremes of the climatic gradient (tropical deciduous woodland, sclerophyllous woodland-shrubland), as well as life-history differences across taxa, which generates a stronger trend to specialisation in small body size lineages than in larger mammals.},

Here, we examine eco-evolutionary processes structuring mammal assemblages on oceanic islands worldwide, including all extant and extinct late-Quaternary mammal species.

We also observe that mammal assemblages often tend to be functionally clustered (share similar traits), but the strength of clustering is weak and generally independent from island area or isolation. These findings indicate the important roles of in situ speciation and dispersal filtering in shaping island mammal assemblages under pre-anthropogenic conditions, notably through adaptive radiation of a few clades (e.g. bats, with generally high dispersal abilities).

We found that conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival of small-to-intermediate-sized focal trees were negative in lower elevation, higher diversity forest stands typically characterised by warmer temperatures and greater relative humidity. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival were less negative in higher elevation stands and ridges than in lower elevation stands and valley bottoms for small-to-intermediate-sized trees, but were neutral for larger trees across elevations. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on growth were negative across all tree size classes and elevations. These findings reveal fundamental differences in biotic interactions that may contribute to relationships between species diversity, elevation and climate.},

	abstract = {The biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationship remains unclear in many natural ecosystems, partially for lack of theoretical and analytical tools that match common characteristics of observational community data. The ecological Price equation promises to meet this need by organizing many different species-level changes into a few ecologically meaningful categories that sum to total ecosystem function change. Current versions of the ecological Price equation focus on species richness and presence-absence. However, abundance and relative abundance are better estimated in samples and are likely showing a stronger response to global change. Here we present a novel, abundance-based version of the ecological Price equation in both discrete and continuous forms and explain the similarities and differences between this method and a related, previously developed richness-based method. We also present new empirical techniques for applying the Price equation to ecological data. Our two demonstration analyses reveal how additive effects of increasing abundance on total function are modified by concurrent selection effects due to shifts in species’ composition, as well as intraspecific change in species’ per-capita function. The ecological Price equations derived here complement existing approaches, and together offer BEF researchers analytical tools and a unifying framework for studying biodiversity-ecosystem function in observational community data.},

	abstract = {Direct interactions among species are only possible if there is some overlap in their geographical distributions. However, despite intense focus of macroecological research on species geographical ranges, relatively little theoretical and empirical work has been done on the evolution of range overlap. In this study we explore a simple model of range overlap based on a log-normal distribution of species range sizes along a one-dimensional domain, with or without absorbing boundary conditions. In particular, we focus on the mean and variance of range overlap distributions, as well as the topology of the resulting overlap networks with respect to their degree distribution, evenness, and betweenness scores. According to the model, there is an approximately linear relationship between many aspects of the distribution of range overlaps and their underlying species distributions, such as their mean and variance. However, the expected mean number of non-zero range overlaps for a given species varied from linear to convex depending on the variance of the underlying geographical range distribution. The expected topology of range overlap networks varied substantially depending on the mean and variance in the corresponding geographical distributions, particularly in the case of the degree and closeness distributions. Finally, we test the expectations of our model against five datasets of altitudinal distributions of Neotropical birds. We found strong departures from the expectations based on our model, which could potentially result from phylogenetic niche conservatism related to altitudinal gradients in environmental conditions, or from the asymmetric colonization of mountains by species from lowlands. Potential applications of range overlap networks to a variety of ecological and evolutionary phenomena are discussed.},

Niche based and sample based SAD models predict different spatial scaling properties of SAD parameters. However, empirical research of SAD scaling properties is largely missing. Here, we extracted percentage cover values of all occurring vascular plants as proxies of their abundance in 1725 10-m2 plots from the GrassPlot database, covering 47 regional data sets of 19 different grassland and other open vegetation types of the Palaearctic biogeographic realm. For each plot, we fitted the Weibull distribution, a model that is able to effectively mimic other distributions like the log-series and lognormal, to the species–log abundance rank order distribution. We calculated the skewness and kurtosis of the empirical distributions and linked these moments, along with the shape and scale parameters of the Weibull distribution, to plot climatic and soil characteristics. The Weibull distribution provided excellent fits to grassland plant communities and identified four basic types of communities characterized by different degrees of dominance. Shape and scale parameter values of local communities on poorer soils were largely in accordance with log-series distributions. Proportions of subdominant species tended to be lower than predicted by the standard lognormal SAD. Successive accumulation of plots of the same vegetation type yielded non-linear spatial scaling of SAD moments and Weibull parameters. This scaling was largely independent of environmental correlates and geographic plot position. Our findings caution against simple generalizations about the mechanisms that generate SADs. We argue that, in grasslands, lognormal type SADs tend to prevail within a wider range of environmental conditions, including more extreme habitats such as arid environments. In contrast, log-series distributions are mainly restricted to comparatively species rich communities on humid and fertile soils.},

	abstract = {The dietary guild structure of ungulate communities is a useful paleoecological tool for understanding the context of hominin paleobiology and evolution. Ungulates are well represented in the fossil record, and their dietary preferences reflect those of major habitat types. However, paleoecology relies on modern ecological patterns as analogs for recreating ecologies of the past. It has previously been suggested that for much of the Pliocene, no such modern analogs exist for the herbivore communities associated with hominins in eastern Africa. This study aims to determine whether the ungulate community associated with A. afarensis at the Pliocene site of Laetoli, Tanzania, shares similarities with extant communities or whether it lacks a modern analog. Our multiproxy approach using mesowear, hypsodonty, and stable carbon isotopes of tooth enamel to infer the diets of ungulates in the Upper Laetolil Beds shows that this community is dominated by browsers and mixed feeders and has a very low prevalence of grazers and frugivores. This dietary guild composition distinguishes the Upper Laetolil Beds from modern African communities and suggests either that the Upper Laetolil Beds had a unique vegetation structure which was able to support a higher diversity of browsing ungulates than that exists in African ecosystems today or that it retained an ungulate community that was resilient to environmental change. The Upper Laetolil Beds ungulate community is also unique relative to other mid-Pliocene communities in eastern Africa, some of which are similar to extant communities, while others, such as Laetoli, lack modern counterparts. This suggests that A. afarensis was a eurytopic species that inhabited a variety of ecosystems, including those with and without modern analogs. The co-occurrence of both analog and nonanalog communities in the Pliocene suggests that the transformation toward ungulate communities of modern aspect occurred asynchronously in eastern Africa.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Fourteen studies of brain size evolution in Plio-Pleistocene hominins published over the past fifty years show substantial long-term increase in endocranial volume (ECV) for the broad lineage leading to modern humans. The median generation-to-generation step rate for a consensus time series of ECV values,
            h
            0
             = 0.15 standard deviations per generation, is almost identical to the median step rate observed in modern biological field studies. When specimens are aggregated in a series of 100 k.y. time bins to reflect the precision of their geological ages, temporal scaling identifies four successive phases of stasis and change that are significantly different from random. Phase I from about 3.2 to 2.0 million years before present is an initial phase of relative stasis. Phase II from 2.0 to 1.5 m.y. is a phase of directional brain size increase. Phase III from 1.5 to 0.7 m.y. is a second phase of stasis. Finally, Phase IV from about 0.7 m.y. to 10 k.y. is a second phase of directional increase. The tempo (rate) and the mode (stasis, random, or directional change) of an evolutionary time series are related to each other, and both are related to the time scale chosen for analysis.},

The Red Queen is neutral with respect to body size, implying that neither small nor large species have a universal competitive advantage. Here we ask whether, and if so how, the Red Queen’s hypothesis really can accommodate differences in body size. The maximum population growth in ecology clearly depends on body size—the smaller the species, the shorter the generation length, and the faster it can expand given sufﬁcient opportunity. On the other hand, large species are more efﬁcient in energy use due to metabolic scaling and can maintain more biomass with the same energy. The advantage of shorter generation makes a wide range of body sizes competitive, yet large species do not take over. We analytically show that individuals consume energy and reproduce in physiological time, but need to compete for energy in real time. The Red Queen, through adaptive evolution of populations, balances the pressures of real and physiological time. Modeling competition for energy as a proportional prize contest from economics, we further show that Red Queen’s zero-sum game can generate unimodal hat-like patterns of species rise and decline that can be neutral in relation to body size.},

	abstract = {* 1Abundance–occupancy relationships comprise some of the most general and well-explored patterns in macro-ecology. The theory governing these relationships predicts that species will exhibit a positive interspecific and intraspecific relationship between regional occupancy and local abundance. Abundance–occupancy relationships have important implications in using distributional surveys, such as atlases, to understand and document large-scale population dynamics and the consequences of environmental change. A basic need for interpreting such data bases is a better understanding of whether changes in regional occupancy reflect changes in local abundance across species of varying life-history characteristics.
* 2Our objective was to test the predictions of the abundance–occupancy rule using two independent data sets, the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas and the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The New York State Breeding Bird Atlas consists of 5332 25-km2 survey blocks and is one of the first atlases in the USA to be completed for two time periods (1980–85 and 2000–05). The North American Breeding Survey is a large-scale annual survey intended to document the relative abundance and population change of songbirds throughout the USA.
* 3We found that regional occupancy was positively correlated with relative abundance across 98 (β = 0·60 ± 0·11 SE, P {\textless} 0·001, R2 = 0·60) and 85 species (β = 0·67 ± 0·06 SE, P {\textless} 0·001, R2 = 0·57) in two separate time periods. This relationship proved stable over time and was notably consistent between breeding habitat groups and migratory guilds.
* 4Between 1980 and 2005, changes in regional occupancy were highly correlated with long-term abundance trend estimates for 75 species (β = 5·73 ± 0·24 SE, P {\textless} 0·001, R2 = 0·88). Over a 20-year period, woodland and resident birds showed an increase in occupancy while grassland species showed the greatest decline; these patterns were mirrored by changes in local abundance.
* 5Although exceptions existed, we found most changes in occupancy parallel changes in local abundance. These findings support the basic predictions of the abundance–occupancy rule and demonstrate its consistency and stability in species and groups of varying life-history characteristics.},

	abstract = {A major criticism of the “overkill” theory for the late Pleistocene extinction in the Americas has been the seeming implausibility of a relatively small number of humans selectively killing off millions of large-bodied mammals. Critics argue that early Paleoindian hunters had to be extremely selective to have produced the highly size-biased extinction pattern characteristic of this event. Here, we derive a probabilistic extinction model that predicts the extinction risk of mammals at any body mass without invoking selective human harvest. The new model systematically analyzes the variability in life-history characteristics, such as the instantaneous mortality rate, age of first reproduction, and the maximum net reproductive rate. It captures the body size–biased extinction pattern in the late Pleistocene and precisely predicts the percentage of unexpectedly persisting large mammals and extinct small ones. A test with a global late Quaternary mammal database well supports the model. The model also emphasizes that quantitatively analyzing patterns of variability in ecological factors can shed light on diverse behaviors and patterns in nature. From a macro-scale conservation perspective, our model can be modified to predict the fate of biota under the pressures from both climate change and human impacts.},

One major goal of modern community ecology is to understand how deterministic and stochastic processes combine to drive community assembly. Little empirical knowledge is known, however, about how their relative importance varies between common and rare species.
Methods
We exploited two 30-year data sets of plant communities in a temperate steppe using two different methods. One is a null model method, and the other is a recently-developed direct-calculation method.
Important Findings
We found that stochastic processes tended to be more important in influencing rare than common species. This finding suggests that stochastic forces may play a more important role in structuring communities with more rare species, providing a possible solution to the debate on the varied importance of deterministic and stochastic processes among different communities.},

This evolutionary expansion is believed to be important to the emergence of human language and other high-order cognitive functions, yet its genetic basis remains unknown. An evolutionary analysis of genes controlling brain development may shed light on it. ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) is one of such genes, as nonsense mutations lead to primary microcephaly, a human disease characterized by a 70\% reduction in brain size. Here I provide evidence suggesting that human ASPM went through an episode of accelerated sequence evolution by positive Darwinian selection after the split of humans and chimpanzees but before the separation of modern non-Africans from Africans. Because positive selection acts on a gene only when the gene function is altered and the organismal fitness is increased, my results suggest that adaptive functional modifications occurred in human ASPM and that it may be a major genetic component underlying the evolution of the human brain.},

	abstract = {China is a key area for research into human occupation in the Old World after the initial expansion of early humans out of Africa. Reliable age determinations are pivotal for assessing the patterns of human evolution and dispersal in this region. This paper reviews magnetostratigraphic studies of some early Pleistocene strata bearing hominin remains and/or artifact stone tools from northern to southern China. The quality and reliability of the paleomagnetic dates are also evaluated. New magnetostratigraphic results for the Xihoudu Paleolithic site in north-central China are also presented.

Among the few hominin or Paleolithic sites in China from the early Pleistocene, five have been well investigated. Three of these are in northern China at Xiaochangliang, Donggutuo and Gongwangling; the remaining two in southern China at Longgupo and Yuanmou. Considerable progress has been made during the past three decades towards paleomagnetically dating these sites. Indeed, the age estimates at Xiaochangliang and Gongwangling have been widely accepted. Magnetostratigraphic consensus about the age of the Donggutuo site has also been reached. However, the age determination for the two sites in southern China is still contested.

The integration of rock-magnetic stratigraphy with magnetic polarity stratigraphy has resulted in a determined age of 1.36 Ma for a stone tool-containing layer of lacustrine sediments at the Xiaochangliang site in the Nihewan Basin. Lithostratigraphic constraints have significantly contributed to determining the age of Lantian Homo erectus at Gongwangling, which occurred in a loess–paleosol sequence of the southern Loess Plateau. Its age, paleomagnetically derived, is about 1.15 Ma. These two paleomagnetic ages suggest an expansion and flourishing of human groups from northern to north-central China during the early Pleistocene. This suggestion has been reinforced by our new magnetostratigraphic age estimate of about 1.27 Ma for the Xihoudu site as will be presented in this paper. However, more work is needed for the age determinations of the hominin-bearing strata at the Longgupo and Yuanmou sites in southern China. Finally, we stress that it is necessary to combine biostratigraphy, lithostratigraphy and rock-magnetic stratigraphy with the traditional magnetic polarity stratigraphy in order to obtain reliable age determinations for strata bearing hominin remains or stone artifacts.},

Such an age estimate, which is ∼270 ka older than previous electron spin resonance and alpha-counting U-series dates, has significant implications for the evolution of Asian H. erectus. Dentine and enamel samples from the coexisting fossil layer yield significantly younger apparent ages, that of the enamel sample being only less than one-fourth of the minimum age of Nanjing Man. This suggests that U uptake history is far more complex than existing models can handle. As a result, great care must be taken in the interpretation of electron spin resonance and U-series dates of fossil teeth.},

Even though all four types of interference competition reduce population biomass, interference competition at intermediate intensity sometimes significantly increases the abundance of adult individuals and the population׳s reproduction rate. We find that foraging and metabolic interference evolutionarily favor smaller maturation size when interference is weak and larger maturation size when interference is strong. The evolutionary response to survival interference and reproductive interference is always larger maturation size. We also investigate how the four types of interference competition impact the evolutionary dynamics and resultant diversity and trophic structure of size-structured communities. Like other types of trait-mediated competition, all four types of interference competition can induce disruptive selection and thus promote initial diversification. Even though foraging interference and reproductive interference are more potent in promoting initial diversification, they catalyze the formation of diverse communities with complex trophic structure only at high levels of interference intensity. By contrast, survival interference does so already at intermediate levels, while reproductive interference can only support relatively smaller communities with simpler trophic structure. Taken together, our results show how the type and intensity of interference competition jointly affect coexistence patterns in structured population models.},

Simulation demonstrates that when no trend exists within time series, ESS can effectively limit the effect of serial correlation on the MK test. When trend exists within time series, the existence of trend will contaminate the estimate of the magnitude of sample serial correlation, and ESS computed from the contaminated serial correlation cannot properly eliminate the effect of serial correlation on the MK test.

Simulation results demonstrate that when trend exists in a time series, the effect of positive/negative serial correlation on the MK test is dependent upon sample size, magnitude of serial correlation, and magnitude of trend. When sample size and magnitude of trend are large enough, serial correlation no longer significantly affects the MK test statistics. Removal of positive AR(1) from time series by prewhitening will remove a portion of trend and hence reduces the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis while it might be false. Contrarily, removal of negative AR(1) by prewhitening will inflate trend and leads to an increase in the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis while it might be true. Therefore, prewhitening is not suitable for eliminating the effect of serial correlation on the MK test when trend exists within a time series.},

	abstract = {Aim

Cenozoic dynamics of large-scale species diversity patterns remain poorly understood, especially for the Western Pacific, in part, because of the paucity of well-dated fossil records from the tropics. This article aims to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of species diversity in the Western Pacific through the Cenozoic, focusing on the tropical Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) biodiversity hotspot.


Location

Tropical and north-western Pacific Ocean.


Methods

We analysed well-preserved fossil ostracodes from the tropical Western Pacific and combined their diversity data with other published data from the region to reconstruct Cenozoic dynamics of species diversity in the tropical and north-western Pacific Ocean. We fitted generalized additive models to test for differences in richness over time and across geographical regions while accounting for sample-size variation among samples.


Results

Low-, mid- and high-latitude regions all show a similar diversity trajectory: diversity is low in the Eocene and Oligocene, increases from the Early Miocene to the Plio-Pleistocene but then declines to the present day. Present-day high biodiversity in these regions was established during the Pliocene with a remarkable diversity increase at that time. Latitudinal diversity patterns are relatively flat and never show a simple decline from the tropics to higher latitudes.


Main conclusions

Western Pacific Cenozoic ostracodes exhibit a spatiotemporal pattern of species diversity that is inconsistent with the commonly reported and persistent pattern of declining diversity from the tropics to the extratropics. While this inconsistency could be interpreted as evidence that ostracodes are a contrarian clade, Atlantic ostracodes display a standard latitudinal species diversity gradient. Contrasting patterns between oceans suggest an important role for regional factors (e.g. plate tectonics and temporal geomorphological dynamics) in shaping the biodiversity of the Western Pacific.},

	abstract = {Conservation biologists have identified threats to the survival of about a quarter of the mammalian species; to identify patterns of rarity and commonness of mammals, we studied a global sample of 1212 species (about 28\% of the mammals) using the ‘7 forms of rarity’ model (in which species are roughly divided into above and below the median for local population density, species’ range area, and number of habitat types). From a niche-based hypothesis of abundance and distribution, we predicted that mammals would exhibit a bimodal pattern of rarity and commonness, with an overabundance of species in the relatively rarest and most common categories; and just such a significant bimodal pattern emerged, with over a quarter of the species classified as exceedingly rare and a further quarter very common, supporting the niche-based hypothesis. Orders that include large mammals, including perissodactyls, primates, diprotodonts, and carnivores, exhibited significantly high proportions of relatively rare species; and tropical zoogeographic regions, especially Indomalaya, had relatively high proportions of species in the rarest category. Significant biases in the available data on mammals included under-sampling of small species like rodents and bats, and a relative paucity of data on zoogeographic regions outside of North America and Australia. Mammalian species listed as of conservation concern by the IUCN occurred in all cells of the model, indicating that even relatively common species can be listed as threatened under some conditions; but we also found that sixty-three species were relatively rare in all three criteria of the 7-forms model but were not listed as threatened, indicating potential candidates for further study. Mammals may be a group of animals where rarity or commonness is a natural aspect of species biology, both confirming and perhaps partly explaining the large proportion of mammals assigned threatened status.},

	abstract = {1. In large-scale field surveys, a binary recording of each species’ detection or nondetection has been increasingly adopted for its simplicity and low cost. Because of the importance of abundance in many studies, it is desirable to obtain inferences about abundance at species-, functional group-, and community-levels from such binary data. 2. We developed a novel hierarchical multi-species abundance model based on species-level detection/nondetection data. The model accounts for the existence of undetected species, and variability in abundance and detectability among species. Species-level detection/nondetection is linked to species-level abundance via a detection model that accommodates the expectation that probability of detection (at least one individuals is detected) increases with local abundance of the species. We applied this model to a 9-year dataset composed of the detection/nondetection of forest birds, at a single post-fire site (from 7 to 15 years after fire) in a montane area of central Japan. The model allocated undetected species into one of the predefined functional groups by assuming a prior distribution on individual group membership. 3. The results suggest that 15–20 species were missed in each year, and that species richness of communities and functional groups did not change with post-fire forest succession. Overall abundance of birds and abundance of functional groups tended to increase over time, although only in the winter, while decreases in detectabilities were observed in several species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Understanding and prediction of large-scale biodiversity dynamics partly hinge on how we can use data effectively. Our hierarchical model for detection/nondetection data estimates abundance in space/time at species-, functional group-, and community-levels while accounting for undetected individuals and species. It also permits comparison of multiple communities by many types of abundance-based diversity and similarity measures under imperfect detection.},

	abstract = {Community N-mixture abundance models for replicated counts provide a powerful and novel framework for drawing inferences related to species abundance within communities subject to imperfect detection. To assess the performance of these models, and to compare them to related community occupancy models in situations with marginal information, we used simulation to examine the effects of mean abundance \$\$({\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}lambda \}\$\$: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5), detection probability \$\$({\textbackslash}bar\{p\}\$\$: 0.1, 0.2, 0.5), and number of sampling sites (nsite: 10, 20, 40) and visits (nvisit: 2, 3, 4) on the bias and precision of species-level parameters (mean abundance and covariate effect) and a community-level parameter (species richness). Bias and imprecision of estimates decreased when any of the four variables \$\$({\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}lambda \}\$\$, \$\${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}\$\$, nsite, nvisit) increased. Detection probability \$\${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}\$\$was most important for the estimates of mean abundance, while \$\${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}lambda \}\$\$was most influential for covariate effect and species richness estimates. For all parameters, increasing nsitewas more beneficial than increasing nvisit. Minimal conditions for obtaining adequate performance of community abundance models were nsite ≥ 20, \$\${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}\$\$ ≥ 0.2, and \$\${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}lambda \}\$\$ ≥ 0.5. At lower abundance, the performance of community abundance and community occupancy models as species richness estimators were comparable. We then used additive partitioning analysis to reveal that raw species counts can overestimate β diversity both of species richness and the Shannon index, while community abundance models yielded better estimates. Community N-mixture abundance models thus have great potential for use with community ecology or conservation applications provided that replicated counts are available.},

This aridification trend is marked by several punctuations at 3.58–3.35, 2.52–2, and 1.81–1.58 Ma, during which the running mean and variance of δ13C and paleoaridity estimates increase, suggesting that the proportion of C4 biomass increases in savanna mosaics during periods of heightened aridity. Increase in C4 biomass during these aridification events not only increases the proportion of open habitats, but increases the spatial neg-entropy, or heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The aridification events identified correspond to intervals of increased turnover, but more importantly, increased diversity of bovids. Although the record of hominins from the Turkana Basin lacks the temporal resolution and diversity of the bovid record, the aridification intervals identified are marked by similar increases in the diversity and turnover of hominins. These results support the hypothesis that hominins evolved in savanna mosaics that changed through time, and suggest that the evolution of bovids and hominins was driven by shifts in climatic instability and habitat variability, both diachronic and synchronic.

Five distinct types of paleosols (pedotypes) are recognized in the Nyakach Formation section at Kaimogool South. The most common paleosols are reddish brown, silty calcareous profiles with blocky structure and large root traces (Ratong pedotype) which are interpreted as soils of well-drained, dry bushland or thicket (nyika). Weakly developed paleosols associated with paleochannels (Dhero pedotype) represent wooded grassland early in the ecological succession from streamside flooding. One of these paleosols has yielded a fossil flora of grasses and small-leaved dicots like those of modern semi-arid wooded grassland. Crumb structured, calcareous paleosols with iron-manganese nodules (Yom pedotype) are interpreted to represent seasonally waterlogged, wooded grassland (dambo or vlei). Thick, red clayey, calcareous paleosols with blocky ped structure and large root traces (Tut pedotype) are interpreted as soils of well-drained dry woodland. Other blocky-structured, gray to brown calcareous paleosols with iron-manganese nodules (Chido pedotype) are interpreted as soils of seasonally waterlogged, riparian dry woodland. Fossil soils, plants and gastropods are evidence of an unusually dry (300–500mm mean annual precipitation) habitat for apes, consisting of a vegetational mosaic dominated by dry woodland, bushland and thickets with few areas of seasonally waterlogged grassland. Fossils of V. macinnesi are rare from Nyakach, but were found in paleosols representative of bushland and thicket habitats (Ratong). Fossils of the ape K. africanus were found within paleosols indicative of dry woodland (Tut). Other paleosol types representative of seasonally dry dambo grassland (Yom), colonizing grassland (Dhero) or riparian woodland (Chido) are also represented, but have not yet produced primate fossils.},

The Nanjing 1 endocast is reconstructed based on two portions of endocranial casts taken from the original fossil fragments. The fossil was discovered in 1993, near Nanjing, South China and is dated to ∼ 0.58–0.62 Ma. The cranial capacity is ∼ 876 cc, as determined by endocast water displacement. There are some common features of Nanjing 1 and other H. erectus endocasts that differentiate them from the Neanderthals and modern humans in our sample. These include small cranial capacity, low height dimensions, simple middle meningeal vessel patterns, a high degree of cerebral-over-cerebellar lobe overhang, elongated and quite separated cerebellar lobes, and a narrow, low, short and flat frontal region. Some features are found to vary among H. erectus, Neanderthals and modern humans, such as the lateral Sylvian fissure position and the venous sinus and petalial patterns. The Nanjing 1 endocast has unique, large, superior frontal convolutions, and strongly protruding Broca's caps. In contrast to other Chinese H. erectus from Hexian and Zhoukoudian, Nanjing 1 lacks strong posterior projection of the occipital lobes. Bivariate and principal component analyses indicate that the small volume and shape of Nanjing 1 is most similar to KNM-WT 15000, KNM-ER 3883, Sangiran 2 and Hexian, illustrating the combination of narrow, low, and short frontal lobes with wide posterior lobes.

	abstract = {Aim

Variation in species composition among sites (β-diversity) generally decreases with increasing latitude, but the underlying mechanisms are ambiguous. Although both local and large-scale processes may drive this pattern, they act all through influencing species abundance distribution (SAD) and spatial pattern of species. A null model incorporating SAD is often used to calculate expected β-diversity, which accounts for most variation in β-diversity. However, a recent study has shown that the deviation of observed β-diversity from expected values (β-deviation) increases with latitude. The latitudinal gradients in β-deviation may be related to both latitudinal differences in SADs and the degrees of spatial aggregation. Our study aims to (1) investigate how β-deviation varies with SAD and spatial aggregation, and (2) separate the contributions of SAD and aggregation in explaining latitudinal gradients in β-deviation.


Location

Global.


Methods

197 forest plots (each containing 10 subplots) distributed along latitudinal gradients were used. Two β-diversity models were derived for communities with randomly and nonrandomly distributed species. The two models were used to simulate relationships of β-deviation with SAD and aggregation, and to separate the contributions of these two factors in explaining latitudinal gradients in β-deviation.


Results

β-deviation increased with the degree of aggregation and peaked at intermediate species abundance. The fraction of β-deviation linked to SAD increased with latitude in global and regional analyses, whereas the fraction of β-deviation linked to aggregation was only significantly correlated with latitude in New World south. The degree of aggregation increased with latitude in New World south, but not in global extent and New World north.


Main conclusions

The latitudinal gradients in β-deviation are primarily explained by latitudinal differences in SADs. Additionally, the expected β-diversity is determined solely by SAD. Therefore, we conclude that latitude-β-diversity gradients at local spatial scales appear to be explained by latitudinal differences in SADs.},

	abstract = {Of the presently recognised early hominid species, Paranthropus boisei is one of the better known from the fossil record and arguably the most distinctive; the latter interpretation rests on the numbers of apparently derived characters it incorporates. The species as traditionally diagnosed is distributed across approximately one million years and is presently confined to samples from East African sites. The hypodigm has been examined for evidence of intraspecific phyletic evolution, with particular emphasis on the areas best represented in the fossil record, namely the teeth and mandible. The results of this examination of 55 mandibular and dental variables, which uses the Γ test statistic for the detection of trend, and nonparametric spline regression (Loess regression) for investigating pattern and rate of temporal change, show that within Paranthropus boisei sensu stricto most evidence of temporally related morphological trends relates to the morphology of the P4 crown. There is little or no evidence of any tendency to increase in overall size through time. Fossils from the Omo Shungura Formation and West Turkana which have been recovered from a time period earlier than the P. boisei sensu stricto hypodigm resemble the latter taxon in some features, but differ from it in aspects of cranial morphology. There is insufficient fossil evidence of the earlier taxon to tell whether it changes through time, but when trends of 47 mandibular and dental variables are assessed across the combined East African “robust” australopithecine sample, there is evidence for a relatively abrupt change around 2.2–2.3 Myr in approximately 25\% of the dental and mandibular remains. Some of these changes correspond with the temporal trends within P. boisei sensu stricto, but others, such as mandible height, do not. If the earlier material is ancestral to P. boisei sensu stricto, evidence from the teeth and jaws is consistent with a punctuated origin for the latter taxon. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Very few of the bones can be exactly named, but, so far as they have been identified by Dr. C. W. Andrews and Mr. E. C. Chubb, they belong to species still living in Rhodesia or to others only slightly different from these.

We develop new quantitative and statistical techniques for measuring, testing, and comparing nestedness, and apply these methods to data from the literature. Significantly nonrandom nestedness was present in all 27 assemblages examined, and tended to be stronger in systems dominated by extinction, such as landbridge islands. Sets of assemblages that were very strongly nested were more likely to have greater species richness on one or a few large sites than on several smaller sites of equivalent total area — that is, to fall toward the “single large” side of the “Single Large Or Several Small” (SLOSS) continuum. Our analysis indicates that nestedness, when quantified as a single number for a presence-absence matrix, measures community-wide differences in incidence (the frequency of occurrence or “distribution” of species). Factors that lead to consistent differences among species in immigration or extinction rates cause strong patterns of nestedness of species assemblages. Nestedness is negatively related to beta diversity: nestedness is low when beta diversity is high, and vice versa. Conservation managers will thus seek to minimize nestedness and the development of nested structure in systems of nature reserves.},

In all, we compiled 279 presence-absence matrices, of which 163 do not overlap in their coverage of species and sites. The survey includes studies on vertebrates, arthropods, mollusks, plants, and other taxa; from north temperate, tropical, and south temperate latitudes. Our results were as follows. Statistically significant nestedness was common. Assemblages from landbridge archipelagos were strongly nested, and immigration experiments were least nested. This adds further empirical support to the hypothesis that extinction plays a major role in producing nested structure. Nestedness was positively correlated with the ratio of the areas of the largest and smallest sites, suggesting that the range in area of sites affects nestedness. Taxonomic differences in nestedness were weak. Higher taxonomic levels showed stronger nesting than their constituent lower taxa. We observed no effect of distance of isolation on nestedness; nor any effects of latitude. With regard to methodology, the metrics Nc and Ut yielded similar results, although Nc proved slightly more flexible in use, and deals differently with tied sites. Similarities also exist in the behavior of N0 (“N”) and Up, and between N1 and Ua. Standardized nestedness metrics were mostly insensitive to matrix size, and were useful in comparative analyses among presence-absence matrices. Most metrics were affected by the proportion of presences in the matrix. All analyses of nestedness, therefore, should test for bias due to matrix fill. We suggest that the factors controlling nested subset structure can be thought of as four filters that species pass to occur at a site: a sampling filter, a distance filter, a habitat filter, and an area filter – and three constraints on community homogeneity: evolutionary history, recent history, and spatial variation in the environment. The scale of examination can also have important effects on the degree of nestedness observed.},

A table in this chapter lists the site, age of remains, dating method, and nature of evidence of Paranthropus discovered in East and southern Africa. It also lists the Paranthropus taxa, which includes Paranthropus aethiopicus, Paranthropus boisei, and Paranthropus robustus. Some researchers have suggested that Homo and Paranthropus may be sister taxa. That is they shared a most recent common ancestor not shared with any other hominin taxon. Different studies have found support for Paranthropus monophyly. Most of the present cladistic evidence is in favor of monophyly. If one is comfortable with the conclusion that hard-tissue morphology is capable of recovering phylogenetic relationships established on the basis of independent genetic evidence, then Paranthropus monophyly must be the hypothesis of choice.},

We discuss the difficulties with studying macroevolution in the hominin clade but suggest that at least one trait, brain size, may provide insight into the tempo and mode of evolution. We also review evidence suggesting that stasis is the dominant signal in two early hominin taxa that have substantial and well-dated fossil records. We discuss the role of evolutionary forces in forming macroevolutionary patterns and find that while natural selection appears to be the dominant force, some well-known interspecific and intraspecific differences in hominins may have been the result of random genetic drift. Lastly, we suggest that homoplasy makes generating reliable hypotheses about relationships among early hominins more difficult than most researchers are willing to admit.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the fossil evidence for human evolution from the earliest hominins to the emergence of Homo erectus. There are many differences between the hard-tissues of living modern humans and chimps/bonobos. Most researchers agree that the last common ancestor (LCA) of the hominin and panin clades was probably more likely to have been chimp/bonobo-like than modern human-like. The earliest members of the hominin clade would most likely have had smaller canine teeth, larger chewing teeth, and thicker lower jaws as compared to the earliest panins. There would also have been some changes in the skull and postcranial skeleton linked with more time spent upright and with a greater dependence on the hind limbs for bipedal walking. These changes would include a forward shift in the foramen magnum, wider hips, habitually more extended knees, and a narrower, more stable, foot. The group, possible hominins, includes Ardipithecus ramidus, Orrorin tugenensis, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, and Ardipithecus kadabba. The main differences between Ar. Kadabba and Ar. ramidus s. s. (sensu stricto) are that the upper canine crowns of the former have longer crests, and that the P3 crown outline of Ar. kadabba is more asymmetrical, and thus more ape-like, than that of Ar. Ramidus. Another group, archaic hominins, covers two genera, Australopithecus and Kenyanthropus. Australopithecus afarensis is the earliest hominin to have a comprehensive fossil record including a skull, several crania, many lower jaws, and sufficient limb bones to be able to estimate stature and body mass.},

The study area contains a long sedimentary record spanning Late Miocene (5.3–11.2 Myr ago) to Holocene times. Exposed in a unique tectonic and volcanic transition zone between the main Ethiopian rift (MER) and the Afar rift, sediments along the western Afar rift margin in the Middle Awash provide a unique window on the Late Miocene of Ethiopia. These deposits have now yielded the earliest hominids, described in an accompanying paper5 and dated here to between 5.54 and 5.77 Myr. These geological and palaeobiological data from the Middle Awash provide fresh perspectives on hominid origins and early evolution. Here we show that these earliest hominids derive from relatively wet and wooded environments that were modulated by tectonic, volcanic, climatic and geomorphic processes. A similar wooded habitat also has been suggested for the 6.0 Myr hominoid fossils recently recovered from Lukeino, Kenya6. These findings require fundamental reassessment of models that invoke a significant role for global climatic change and/or savannah habitat in the origin of hominids.},

Seventy nine measurements (35 dental, 16 mandibular and 28 cranial) formed the basis of the study. The patterns of mean differences and dispersions between the taxa were compared across the anatomical regions and the group structures of the separate sex samples were analysed using multivariate (PCA and CVA) analysis. Within and between group variations were compared across the taxa to investigate whether any variables were consistently effective sex or taxonomic discriminators. The study confirmed that there were differences in degree and pattern of sexual dimorphism between the extant higher primates, but the results did not substantiate the distribution of patterns as suggested by Oxnard et al. (1985); in particular there was no evidence of the dispersion differences noted by those authors. There were sufficient consistencies in the behaviour of variables across the four taxa to suggest that all canine dimensions, postcanine crown buccolingual dimensions and mandibular and cranial breadths are generally good sex discriminators, whereas some incisor dimensions, postcanine crown mesiodistal dimensions and facial heights are more effective at discriminating between the four extant taxa included in this study.},

	abstract = {Patterns of habitat partitioning have been widely described, but how the patterns are formed is as yet incompletely understood. To document and describe the different types of community organization that can produce patterns of partitioning, I surveyed the literature to find examples of habitat partitioning. I then identified, characterized, and tabulated occurrences of the different types of community organization. In ten years of Ecology, there were 66 instances of habitat partitioning accompanied by experimental demonstrations of how the patterns were formed. Shared preferences and distinct preferences were most commonly cited as producing patterns of partitioning (34 and 17 times, respectively), but there were also 8 examples of one-sided preferences, 4 examples of centrifugal organization, and 3 instances of niche contraction. This indicates that a variety of community organizations can produce patterns of partitioning and that shared preferences may occur more frequently in nature than generally thought. The presence of particular types of organization was influenced by the kind of study organism, with shared preferences occurring more frequently than distinct preferences among autotrophs and among different-aged individuals of the same species. Distinct preferences occurred when species were partitioned on different hosts rather than along gradients, suggesting that the kinds of resources that species use in a habitat may also influence how patterns of partitioning are formed.},

	abstract = {Fossil evidence from the Plio-Pleistocene of Africa apparently has confirmed a multi-lineage interpretation of early hominid evolution. Empirical refutation of the single species hypothesis must now be matched to the evolutionary ecology theory, which can underwrite taxonomic assessment and help to explain sympatric hominid coexistence. This paper contributes to that goal by reassessing the ecological rationale provided for the single-species hypothesis. Limiting similarity concepts indicate that the allowable ecological overlap between sympatric competitors is greater than the degrees of metric overlap often advanced as standards for identifying fossil species. Optimal foraging theory and the compression hypothesis show that the initial ecological reaction of a hominid to a sympatric competitor would likely be micro-habitat divergence and possibly also temporal differentiation of resource use. The long-term, evolutionary response is niche divergence, probably involving diet as well. General niche partitioning studies suggest that diet and habitat are the most common dimensions of niche separation, although temporal separation is unusually frequent in carnivores. The equation of niche with culture, basic to the single-species hypothesis, has no analytic meaning. Finally, four minor points are discussed, suggesting that (a) extinction is not unlikely, even for a long-lived and competitively competent hominid lineage, (b)parsimony is fickle, (c)interspecific mutualism may jeopardize survival, and (d)generalists are subordinate competitors, but for hominids, seemingly, successful ones. I argue that analog models of hominid paleoecology should be replaced by the use of zoological and anthropological observations to assess the generality and reliability of ecological theory and comcepts that may encompass early hominids.},

These include: patchiness and grain; stability and resilience; persistence and recurrence; and predictability, constancy, and contingency.

Others apparently accept the association between competitive exclusion and a single species view, and develop multi-species interpretations using only taxonomic concepts. This paper demonstrates that the competitive exclusion principle itself is too assumption-bound to be appropriate for analyzing questions of hominid coexistence. Especially, the principle does not establish the ecological validity of the single-species hypothesis. Contrary to its immediate appearances, the principle has developed historically and analytically to predict and explain the evolution and maintenance of diversity in communities. Used in this manner it constitutes an important basis for the study of hominid paleoecology. Niche concepts necessary to demonstrate this are introduced, and competition and other factors that may have influenced the realized niches of sympatric hominid species are discussed. Nearly all modifications of the competitive exclusion principle that make it more realistic also illuminate factors that generate stable coexistence among competing species. These factors and their organizing theory establish the relevance of a broad data base to the analysis of hominid paleoecology; they should help to guide research on the ecology of early homonid species and their interrelationships.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  Relative abundance distributions (RADs) are an important feature of community structure, but little is known of the factors affecting which type of RAD is observed in a particular community. We examined the influences of species richness and of spatial scale on the RAD of plant communities. The effect of species richness was examined by analysing simulated communities generated under the Broken stick model, the Sequential breakage model, and a randomized version of Niche pre-emption model. In all cases, when there were few species in the community the data only occasionally gave the best fit to the model that was used to generate it. With 40–65 species, a best fit was obtained for the correct model in about 75 \% of cases, almost irrespective of the model. Effects of spatial scale were examined in data from four dune slacks and from two semi-arid grasslands, by analysing biomass values at a range of sample sizes. The model that best fitted the whole sample differed between the four slacks and between the slacks and the semi-arid grasslands. The change in which model of RAD fitted best, as sample size was reduced, varied between sites and between habitat types. At the smallest sample sizes, the Zipf-Mandelbrot model often fitted, and in the slack sites the Broken stick also, though neither fitted (in the vegetation examined) at larger spatial scales. It is concluded the RAD is affected by species richness and by spatial scale, in ways that currently do not enable simple prediction. RADs can theoretically give information on the processes such as resource partitioning, immigration and competition that have structured the community, but they are a blunt tool for this purpose.},

Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche ‘dimensions’, or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification.},

	abstract = {The fundamental niche comprises the range of environmental variables under which a species can live. Specialist species have narrower fundamental niches than do generalists. Thus, specialists benefit from homogeneous environments while generalists can exploit heterogeneous ones. The challenge is distinguishing relative specialists from generalists in a sedimentary rock succession. This is overcome by taking replicate samples from several horizons in a heterogeneous formation and comparing species' mean percentage abundances using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean proportional abundances of specialists will differ between horizons in a heterogeneous succession, while those of generalists will not.

The Globorotalia fohsi robusta Zone Middle Miocene Cipero Formation of Trinidad, western central Atlantic Ocean, consists of alternating, diffuse layers of light to dark grey clays. Five replicates of 40 g each were taken from four horizons across a light- to dark-grey cycle. They were picked entirely clean of benthic foraminifera, of which they yielded 5186 specimens in 153 species. Total recovery was dominated by Brizalina cf. tectiformis, with lesser Globocassidulina subglobosa, Pleurostomella alazanensis and Planulina wuellerstorfi. ANOVA applied to each species in turn indicated three species groups: 64 accessory species (each represented by ≤ 3 specimens, ≤ 0.06\% of total recovery); 21 specialist species, for which mean percentage abundance varied significantly between at least two horizons; and 68 generalist species, for which mean percentage abundances did not differ across the horizons. It might be thought that ANOVA would preferentially assign a specialist status to less abundant species. However, this did not happen; of the four most abundant species, P. alazanensis was a specialist, while B. cf. tectiformis, G. subglobosa and P. wuellerstorfi were generalists. The mean percentage abundance of the specialist species did not differ from that of the generalists.

Both specialist and generalist species have palaeoenvironmental applications. The generalist nature of P. wuellerstorfi shows that bottom current strength probably did not differ across the four horizons. The occurrence of the specialist and opportunistic Epistominella exigua in the lowest horizon indicates an interlude of seasonal phytodetrital flux, while sequential increases in the mean percentage abundance of the specialists Oridorsalis umbonatus and Uvigerina auberiana show that the organic carbon flux increased across the four horizons.},

Here, we analyse 254 body mass and 204 stature estimates from a total of 311 hominin specimens dating from 4.4 Ma to the Holocene using multi-level chronological and taxonomic analytical categories. The results demonstrate complex temporal patterns of body size variation with phases of relative stasis intermitted by periods of rapid increases. The observed trajectories could result from punctuated increases at speciation events, but also differential proliferation of large-bodied taxa or the extinction of small-bodied populations. Combined taxonomic and temporal analyses show that in relation to australopithecines, early Homo is characterized by significantly larger average body mass and stature but retains considerable diversity, including small body sizes. Within later Homo, stature and body mass evolution follow different trajectories: average modern stature is maintained from ca 1.6 Ma, while consistently higher body masses are not established until the Middle Pleistocene at ca 0.5–0.4 Ma, likely caused by directional selection related to colonizing higher latitudes. Selection against small-bodied individuals (less than 40 kg; less than 140 cm) after 1.4 Ma is associated with a decrease in relative size variability in later Homo species compared with earlier Homo and australopithecines. The isolated small-bodied individuals of Homo naledi (ca 0.3 Ma) and Homo floresiensis (ca 100–60 ka) constitute important exceptions to these general patterns, adding further layers of complexity to the evolution of body size within the genus Homo. At the end of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, body size in Homo sapiens declines on average, but also extends to lower limits not seen in comparable frequency since early Homo.},

We hypothesize that stochastic dilution effects owing to increasing species richness overpower signals of species associations, thereby yielding approximate species independence. Indeed, the proportion of species pairs showing: (i) no significant interspecific association increased with species richness, (ii) segregation decreased with species richness, and (iii) small-scale interspecific interaction decreased with species richness. This suggests that independence may indeed be a good approximation in the limit of very species-rich communities. Our findings are a step towards a better understanding of factors governing species-rich communities and we propose a hypothesis to explain why species placement in species-rich communities approximates independence.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT A major goal of research in ecology and evolution is to explain why species richness varies across habitats, regions, and clades. Recent reviews have argued that species richness patterns among regions and clades may be explained by “ecological limits” on diversity over time, which are said to offer an alternative explanation to those invoking speciation and extinction (diversification) and time. Further, it has been proposed that this hypothesis is best supported by failure to find a positive relationship between time (e.g., clade age) and species richness. Here, I critically review the evidence for these claims, and propose how we might better study the ecological and evolutionary origins of species richness patterns. In fact, ecological limits can only influence species richness in clades by influencing speciation and extinction, and so this new “alternative paradigm” is simply one facet of the traditional idea that ecology influences diversification. The only direct evidence for strict ecological limits on richness (i.e., constant diversity over time) is from the fossil record, but many studies cited as supporting this pattern do not, and there is evidence for increasing richness over time. Negative evidence for a relationship between clade age and richness among extant clades is not positive evidence for constant diversity over time, and many recent analyses finding no age-diversity relationship were biased to reach this conclusion. More comprehensive analyses strongly support a positive age-richness relationship. There is abundant evidence that both time and ecological influences on diversification rates are important drivers of both large-scale and small-scale species richness patterns. The major challenge for future studies is to understand the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the relationships between time, dispersal, diversification, and species richness patterns.},

Difficulties impeding the interpretation of b are resolved: 1) biological significance cannot be dismissed on dimensional grounds; 2) the interval over which the measurements are valid must be stated as part of the equation; 3) b considered as the y-value at x = 1, in general has no biological meaning; 4) relations between b and k in a family of allometric equations have no biological significance. Examples which illustrate the biological meaning of b are presented in three categories: ontogenetic examples; b as a taxonomic indicator; phylogenetic and evolutionary examples. For a general interpretation of b in y = b xk where k is held constant, b is expressed in terms of a linear scale factor "s" which denotes relative magnitudes between corresponding sets of data having the same dimensionless properties (y/x, dy/dx). b can thus be interpreted as a factor dependent upon scale; and the allometric equation re-written y = s1-k xk, xi ≤ x ≤ xj, k ≠ 1. It is concluded that b is not only biologically interpretable, but that expressed in terms of s, it offers a means of quantitatively considering similarity of biologic forms which exists when corresponding measurements are in the same scale ratio (s-ratio), and when corresponding dimensionless numbers are equal.},

	abstract = {The species abundance distribution (SAD) is one of the most studied patterns in ecology due to its potential insights into commonness and rarity, community assembly, and patterns of biodiversity. It is well established that communities are composed of a few common and many rare species, and numerous theoretical models have been proposed to explain this pattern. However, no attempt has been made to determine how well these theoretical characterizations capture observed taxonomic and global-scale spatial variation in the general form of the distribution. Here, using data of a scope unprecedented in community ecology, we show that a simple maximum entropy model produces a truncated log-series distribution that can predict between 83\% and 93\% of the observed variation in the rank abundance of species across 15 848 globally distributed communities including birds, mammals, plants, and butterflies. This model requires knowledge of only the species richness and total abundance of the community to predict the full abundance distribution, which suggests that these factors are sufficient to understand the distribution for most purposes. Since geographic patterns in richness and abundance can often be successfully modeled, this approach should allow the distribution of commonness and rarity to be characterized, even in locations where empirical data are unavailable.},

	abstract = {Summary
Allometric laws which scale numerous biomechanical and physiological processes to size in mammals have long been recognized and widely used in biology. There is now sufficient evidence to suggest that those life history parameters such as growth and maximum rates of reproduction, which depend in part on metabolic rate, are also scaled to size. Data are presented which, coupled with a literature review, show that gestation time, growth rates, age at first reproduction, lifespan, the intrinsic rate of natural increase, birth rate, net reproductive rate and litter weight are allometrically scaled to size and are, in consequence, inter-related. The exponents of the scaling functions are similar in all mammalian orders but in some taxa such as the primates, the species grow slower, live longer and reproduce at a lower rate. For these taxa the differences in life history parameters can be explained by differences in brain size and an existing hypothesis that the maximum rate of neural tissue growth constrains the maximum rate of growth and development of the entire organism.It is then argued that because size scales the main life history parameters of mammals it should also be a central theme in ecology from the individual to the community level of organisation. Examples are presented to show that size is ubiquitous in ecology and accounts for most of the variation in life history parameters between species. Size scaling offers a method of reducing species of varying size to similar dimensions of time, space and rates of action. It is therefore fundamental in distinguishing those life history parameters which arise as a consequence of size, the first order strategies, from those that vary between populations and according to environmental circumstances, the second order strategies. From this approach should develop a broader biological synthesis in which genetic and physiological determinants will inevitably feature more centrally than they do in ecological and behavioural theory.
Résumé
Les lois allométriques unissant les processus biomécaniques et physiologiques avec la taille chez les mammifères ont été reconnues depuis longtemps et largement utilisées en biologic Il y a maintenant assez de certitude pour suggérer que les paramètres biologiques tels que croissance et taux maximal de reproduction, qui dépendent partiellement du rendement métabolique, sont aussi fonctions de la taille. Les données présentées ici, couplées avec une revue de la littérature, montrent que la durée de gestation, le taux de croissance, l'âge à la première reproduction, la durée de vie, le taux intrinsèque d'accroissement naturel, le taux de natalité, le taux de reproduction net et le poids de la portée sont en relation allométrique avec la taille et, par conséquent, sont en interrelation.},

We show how these approaches can be combined to simultaneously estimate occurrence, abundance, and detection probability by specifying a zero-inflated distribution for abundance. This approach may be particularly appropriate when patterns of occurrence and abundance arise from distinct processes operating at differing spatial or temporal scales. We apply the model to two data sets: (1) previously published data for a species of duck, Anas platyrhynchos, and (2) data for a stream fish species, Etheostoma scotti. We show that in these cases, an incomplete-detection zero-inflated modeling approach yields a superior fit to the data than other models. We propose that zero-inflated abundance models accounting for incomplete detection be considered when replicate count data are available.},

	abstract = {We show that occupancy models are more difficult to fit than is generally appreciated because the estimating equations often have multiple solutions, including boundary estimates which produce fitted probabilities of zero or one. The estimates are unstable when the data are sparse, making them difficult to interpret, and, even in ideal situations, highly variable. As a consequence, making accurate inference is difficult. When abundance varies over sites (which is the general rule in ecology because we expect spatial variance in abundance) and detection depends on abundance, the standard analysis suffers bias (attenuation in detection, biased estimates of occupancy and potentially finding misleading relationships between occupancy and other covariates), asymmetric sampling distributions, and slow convergence of the sampling distributions to normality. The key result of this paper is that the biases are of similar magnitude to those obtained when we ignore non-detection entirely. The fact that abundance is subject to detection error and hence is not directly observable, means that we cannot tell when bias is present (or, equivalently, how large it is) and we cannot adjust for it. This implies that we cannot tell which fit is better: the fit from the occupancy model or the fit ignoring the possibility of detection error. Therefore trying to adjust occupancy models for non-detection can be as misleading as ignoring non-detection completely. Ignoring non-detection can actually be better than trying to adjust for it.},

The model is used to argue that the two-species explanation of Australopithecine fossils is unrealistic and that a one-species view is more compatible with the facts.

The metaphor of the periscope is too limited, however; a video recorder from high in space with resolution in places up to 10 m is more encompassing of what is possible. The images that are retrieved can be of high or low resolution temporally, spatially, taxonomically, and numerically, and they can illustrate local to global changes in plant populations, vegetation, climate, human activity, fire frequency, and plant diseases over decades to millennia. Because each of these entities or phenomena varies spatially and temporally, records of data covering a breadth of scales in space and time are needed. To obtain the highest quality images about a specific phenomenon requires an understanding of the sensing system that accumulated the data. How does the periscope or video recorder work and what are the scaling characteristics of the images that it registers? These characteristics include breadth of coverage, sampling resolution, and sampling density in time, space, and taxonomy. Actualistic and taphonomic studies of Quaternary data covering a variety of temporal and spatial scales have helped provide this understanding, and temporal resolution is just one concern in these studies.},

The authors' emphasis is not on technical details but rather on step-by-step explanations of the wealth of examples included here, from brain evolution to surgical planning, always in light of the relevance of these approaches to science and to society.

This paper lists all fossils attributed to A. anamensis, and provides anatomical descriptions of those not yet described in detail with photographs of all but undiagnostic fragments. We also provide comparative analysis of these specimens. The A. anamensis holotype mandible was found at Kanapoi, as were most of the paratypes. The Allia Bay sample is less well represented, and does not preserve many anatomical elements diagnostic of this species. Still, the Allia Bay sample most closely resembles that from Kanapoi, and we suggest that for the time being it be retained as A. anamensis. A. anamensis most closely resembles A. afarensis, but can be distinguished from it in many features. Most of these features are inferred to be primitive for the genus. Based on the limited postcranial evidence available, A. anamensis appears to have been habitually bipedal, although it retained some primitive features of its upper limbs. A. anamensis differs from A. afarensis in having narrower, more parallel jaws with a very slightly more ape-like canine/premolar complex than is found in A. afarensis, although not as ape-like as inArdipithecus ramidus . It had slightly larger lower lateral incisors, a unique upper canine morphology, and a different structure of the lateral nasal aperture than A. afarensis. A. anamensis had at least as great a range of body size, and perhaps slightly greater canine dimorphism, although this is difficult to determine. At present, there appears to be no autapomorphies precluding A. anamensis from ancestry of A. afarensis.},

However, resulting temporal trends in the relationships between these variables (i.e. macroecological patterns) have received little attention.
* 2Positive relationships between the local abundance and regional occupancy of species (abundance–occupancy relationships) are among the most pervasive of all macroecological patterns. In the absence of formal predictions of how abundance–occupancy relationships may vary temporally, we outline several scenarios of how changes in abundance within species might affect interspecific patterns.
* 3We use data on the distribution and abundance of 73 farmland and 55 woodland bird species in Britain over a 32-year period encompassing substantial habitat modification to assess the likelihood of these scenarios.
* 4In both farmland and woodland habitats, the interspecific abundance–occupancy relationship changed markedly over the period 1968–99, with a significant decline in the strength of the relationship.
* 5Consideration of intraspecific dynamics shows that this has been due to a decoupling of abundance and occupancy particularly in rare and declining species. Insights into the intraspecific processes responsible for the interspecific trend are obtained by analysis of temporal trends in the distribution of individuals between sites, which show patterns consistent with habitat quality declines.
* 6This study shows that a profitable approach to ascertaining the nature of human impacts is to link intra- and interspecific processes. In the case of British farmland and woodland birds, changes to the environment lead to species-specific responses in large-scale distributions. These species-specific changes are the driver of the observed changes in the form and strength of the interspecific relationship.},

Carpometacarpal articulations are intermediate between those of modern humans and African apes, suggesting enhanced gripping capabilities compared with extant apes. The hamulus was strikingly large, similar in proportion only to Neandertals and some gorillas, suggesting the presence of powerful forearms and hands. There are no indicators of adaptations to knuckle-walking or suspensory locomotion in the hand, and the pedal phalanx suggests that this hominid was habitually bipedal.},

	abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed to estimate the position of a mass extinction boundary while accounting for the incompleteness of the fossil record. Here we describe the point estimator and confidence interval for the extinction that are optimal under the assumption of uniform preservation and recovery potential, and independence among taxa. First, one should pool the data from all taxa into one combined “supersample.” Next, one can then apply methods proposed by Strauss and Sadler (1989) for a single taxon. This gives the optimal point estimator in the sense that it has the smallest variance among all possible unbiased estimators. The corresponding confidence interval is optimal in the sense that it has the shortest average width among all possible intervals that are invariant to measurement scale. These optimality properties hold even among methods that have not yet been discovered. Using simulations, we show that the optimal estimators substantially improve upon the performance of other existing methods. Because the assumptions of uniform recovery and independence among taxa are strong ones, it is important to assess to what extent they are satisfied by the data. We demonstrate the use of probability plots for this purpose. Finally, we use simulations to explore the sensitivity of the optimal point estimator and confidence interval to nonuniformity and lack of independence, and we compare their performance under these conditions with existing methods. We find that nonuniformity strongly biases the point estimators for all methods studied, inflates their standard errors, and degrades the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals. Lack of independence has less effect on the accuracy of point estimates as long as recovery potential is uniform, but it, too, inflates the standard errors and degrades confidence interval coverage probabilities.},

	abstract = {.  Numerous methods exist for estimating the true stratigraphic range of a fossil taxon based on the stratigraphic positions of its fossil occurrences. Many of these methods require the assumption of uniform fossil recovery potential—that fossils are equally likely to be found at any point within the taxon's true range. This assumption is unrealistic, because factors such as stratigraphic architecture, sampling effort, and the taxon's abundance and geographic range affect recovery potential. Other methods do not make this assumption, but they instead require a priori quantitative knowledge of recovery potential that may be difficult to obtain. We present a new Bayesian method, the Adaptive Beta method, for estimating the true stratigraphic range of a taxon that works for both uniform and non-uniform recovery potential. In contrast to existing methods, we explicitly estimate recovery potential from the positions of the occurrences themselves, so that a priori knowledge of recovery potential is not required. Using simulated datasets, we compare the performance of our method with existing methods. We show that the Adaptive Beta method performs well in that it achieves or nearly achieves nominal coverage probabilities and provides reasonable point estimates of the true extinction in a variety of situations. We demonstrate the method using a dataset of the Cambrian mollusc Anabarella.},

Both niche-based and neutral processes may produce a distance decay relationship; however, disentangling their relative influence requires simultaneous examination of multiple potential drivers. Parasites represent a unique opportunity in which to study distance decay because community dissimilarity may depend on environmental requirements and dispersal capability of parasites as well also those of their hosts. We used big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus and their intestinal helminths to investigate: 1) independent contributions of geographic and environmental distances on dissimilarity of intestinal helminth component communities between populations of big brown bats; 2) which environmental variables best explained variation in community dissimilarity; and 3) whether similar patterns of decay with geographic or environmental distance were observed for within-host population and within-individual host parasite communities. We used compositional measures of community dissimilarity to examine how parasite communities may change with geographic distance and varying environmental conditions. Non-spatial variables strongly influenced compositional parasite community dissimilarity over multiple community scales, and we observed little evidence for spatial processes such as distance decay. Environment surrounding roost sites better predicted helminth community dissimilarity than any other class of variables and landcover classes representing anthropogenic modification consistently explained variation in community structure. Our results indicate that human disturbance drives significant patterns of parasite community dissimilarity, most likely by changing the presence or abundance of intermediate hosts in an area.

We review empirical data for one well studied group of vertebrates, salamanders of the family Plethodontidae. Despite much evolution at the level of allozymes, proteins such as albumin, and DNA, morphological evolution has been slow, and has been concentrated in relatively short spans of time. The dominant theme has been morphological stasis. An important contributing factor appears to be plasticity—behavioral, physiological, and developmental—which allows organisms to compensate environmental, and even genetic, perturbations without having to change morphologically. Organisms are self-produced and self-maintained systems, and we argue that the best measure of evolutionary adaptation is the persistence of this autopoietic system. Internal dynamics of the organism determine what change will occur and how it is to be expressed. Stable systems can be established which transcend species borders, and the fossil record offers no evidence with regard to speciation rates, or the relationship of speciation events to morphological evolution. We urge that more emphasis be placed on the organism in evolutionary studies.},

	abstract = {Understanding what governs community assembly and the maintenance of biodiversity is a central issue in ecology, but has been a continuing debate. A key question is the relative importance of habitat specialization (niche assembly) and dispersal limitation (dispersal assembly). In the middle of the Loess Plateau, northwestern China, we examined how species turnover in Liaodong oak (Quercus wutaishanica) forests differed between observed and randomized assemblies, and how this difference was affected by habitat specialization and dispersal limitation using variation partitioning. Results showed that expected species turnover based on individual randomization was significantly lower than the observed value (P {\textless} 0.01). The turnover deviation significantly depended on the environmental and geographical distances (P {\textless} 0.05). Environmental and spatial variables significantly explained approximately 40\% of the species composition variation at all the three layers (P {\textless} 0.05). However, their contributions varied among forest layers; the herb and shrub layers were dominated by environmental factors, whereas the canopy layer was dominated by spatial factors. Our results underscore the importance of synthetic models that integrate effects of both dispersal and niche assembly for understanding the community assembly. However, habitat specialization (niche assembly) may not always be the dominant process in community assembly, even under harsh environments. Community assembly may be in a trait-dependent manner (e.g., forest layers in this study). Thus, taking more species traits into account would strengthen our confidence in the inferred assembly mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Tree-based paleobiological studies use inferred phylogenies as models to test hypotheses about macroevolution and the quality of the fossil record. Such studies raise two concerns. The first is how model trees might bias results. The second is testing hypotheses about parameters that affect tree inference. Bias introduced by model trees is explored for tree-based assessments of the quality of the fossil record. Several nuisance parameters affect tree-based metrics, including consistency of sampling probability, rates of speciation / extinction, patterns of speciation, applied taxonomic philosophy, and assumed taxonomy. The first two factors affect probabilistic assessments of sampling, but also can be tested and accommodated in sophisticated probability tests. However, the final three parameters (and the assumption of a correct phylogeny) do not affect probabilistic assessments. Often paleobiologists wish to test hypotheses such as rates of character change or rates of preservation. Assumptions about such parameters are necessary in simple phylogenetic methods, even if the assumptions are that rates are homogeneous or that sampling is irrelevant. Likelihood tests that evaluate phylogenies in light of stratigraphic data and / or alternative hypotheses of character evolution can reduce assumptions about unknowns by testing numerous unknowns simultaneously. Such tests have received numerous criticisms, largely based in philosophy. However, such criticisms are based on incorrect depictions of the logical structures of parsimony and likelihood, misunderstandings about when arguments are probabilistic (as opposed to Boolean), overly restrictive concepts of when data can test a hypothesis, and simply incorrect definitions of some terms. Likelihood methods can test multiparameter hypotheses about phylogeny and character evolution (i.e., rates, independence, etc.). The best hypothesis positing a single rate of independent character change (with no variation among character states) is determined for each topology. Hypotheses about rate variation among characters or across phylogeny, character independence, and different patterns of state evolution then are examined until one finds the simplest (i.e., fewest varying parameters) hypothesis that cannot be rejected given knowledge of a more complicated hypothesis. This is repeated for alternative topologies. An example is presented using hyaenids. Two trees are contrasted, one of which requires the minimum necessary steps and the other of which requires at least seven additional steps. Given either tree, likelihood rejects fewer than three general rates of character change and also rejects the hypothesis of independence among the characters. However, hypotheses of changes in rates across the tree do not add substantially to the tree likelihood. The likelihoods of the trees given stratigraphic data also are determined. Both morphologic and stratigraphic data suggest that the multiparameter hypothesis including the parsimony tree is significantly less likely than the multiparameter hypothesis including a different tree.},

Evolutionary biologists debate the impact of external restrictions imposed by ecology, and intrinsic constraints imposed by development and genetics, on the rate at which morphological innovations are gained. These issues are particularly interesting for groups such as tetrapods, which evolved novel body plans relative to their piscine ancestors and which also invaded new ecosystems following terrestrialization. Prior studies have addressed these issues by looking at either ranges of morphological variation or rates of character change. Here, we address a related but distinct issue: the numbers of characters that freely vary within a clade. We modify techniques similar to those used by ecologists to infer species richnesses to estimate the number of potentially varying characters given the distributions of changes implied by a model phylogeny. Our results suggest both increasing constraints/restrictions and episodes of ‘character release’ (i.e. increasing the number of potentially varying characters). In particular, we show that stem lissamphibians had a restricted character space relative to that of stem amniotes, and that stem amniotes both had restrictions on some parts of character space but also invaded new character space that had been unavailable to stem tetrapods.},

Three general models connect these patterns to anatomical evolution: (i) elevated net extinction of taxa bearing particular traits, (ii) elevated net speciation of taxa bearing particular traits, and (iii) elevated evolvability expanding the range of anatomies available to some species. Trait-based diversification shifts predict elevated hierarchical stratigraphic compatibility (i.e., primitive→derived→highly derived sequences) among pairs of anatomical characters. The three specific models further predict (i) early loss of diversity for taxa retaining primitive conditions (elevated net extinction), (ii) increased diversification among later members of a clade (elevated net speciation), and (iii) increased disparity among later members in a clade (elevated evolvability). Analyses of 319 anatomical and stratigraphic datasets for fossil species and genera show that hierarchical stratigraphic compatibility exceeds the expectations of trait-independent diversification in the vast majority of cases, which was expected if trait-dependent diversification shifts are common. Excess hierarchical stratigraphic compatibility correlates with early loss of diversity for groups retaining primitive conditions rather than delayed bursts of diversity or disparity across entire clades. Cambrian clades (predominantly trilobites) alone fit null expectations well. However, it is not clear whether evolution was unusual among Cambrian taxa or only early trilobites. At least among post-Cambrian taxa, these results implicate models, such as competition and extinction selectivity/resistance, as major drivers of trait-based diversification shifts at the species and genus levels while contradicting the predictions of elevated net speciation and elevated evolvability models.},

We demonstrate this strategy by comparing the model fit and resulting inferences from applying four different distributions to model use of substances that range greatly in the prevalence and frequency of their use. Methods: Using Timeline Followback (TLFB) data from a previously-published study, we used negative binomial, beta-binomial and their zero-inflated counterparts to model proportion of days during treatment of cannabis, cigarettes, alcohol, and opioid use. The fit for each distribution was evaluated with statistical model selection criteria, visual plots and a comparison of the resulting inferences. Results: We demonstrate the feasibility and utility of modeling each substance individually and show that no single distribution provides the best fit for all substances. Inferences regarding use of each substance and associations with important clinical variables were not consistent across models and differed by substance. Conclusion: Thus, the distribution chosen for modeling substance use must be carefully selected and evaluated because it may impact the resulting conclusions. Furthermore, the common procedure of aggregating use across different substances may not be ideal.},

	abstract = {Cladograms predict the order in which fossil taxa appeared and, thus, make predictions about general patterns in the stratigraphic record. Inconsistencies between cladistic predictions and the observed stratigraphic record reflect either inadequate sampling of a clade's species, incomplete estimates of stratigraphic ranges, or homoplasy producing an incorrect phylogenetic hypothesis. A method presented in this paper attempts to separate the effects of homoplasy from the effects of inadequate sampling. Sampling densities of individual species are used to calculate confidence intervals on their stratigraphic ranges. The method uses these confidence intervals to test the order of branching predicted by a cladogram. The Lophospiridae (“Archaeogastropoda”) of the Ordovician provide a useful test group because the clade has a good fossil record and it produced species over a long time. Confidence intervals reject several cladistic hypotheses that postulate improbable “ghost lineages.” Other hypotheses are acceptable only with explicit ancestor-descendant relationships. The accepted cladogram is the shortest one that stratigraphic data cannot reject. The results caution against evaluating phylogenetic hypotheses of fossil taxa without considering both stratigraphic data and the possible presence of ancestral species, as both factors can affect interpretations of a clade's evolutionary dynamics and its patterns of morphologic evolution.},

	abstract = {The balance of power (that is the dominance on the predation arena between carnivore competitors and hominins) remains controversial. One reflection of this is the carnivore modification of hominin bones. During human evolution, hominins were first prey and then predators of other animals, including carnivores. Modifications reported on some hominin bones could result from primary predators feeding on them or post-depositional modifications by scavengers. Determining carnivore agency would be crucial to interpret such information. Here, a series of computer vision models based on convolutional neural networks is presented, comparing five different types of carnivores jointly and then pairwise. It is shown how such models contain different heuristics regarding specific carnivore taxa, which regarding tooth marks made by lions and spotted hyenas can be accurately classified by as much as 92\% of the testing set. The present study also shows the potential of transfer knowledge in building accurate classification of images and for taphonomic interpretation. The application to tooth marking on a 500 ka hominin femoral shaft indicates that by that time, carnivore modifications of human remains may have resulted from post-depositional scavenging rather than by predation.},

	abstract = {The brain is a very expensive organ in metabolic terms. Each unit of brain tissue requires over 22 times the amount of metabolic energy as an equivalent unit of muscle tissue. There is no correlation across mammals, however, between the relative size of the brain and the relative basal metabolic rate. The Expensive Tissue Hypothesis explains this apparent paradox by looking at the metabolic cost of the brain in the context of the costs of other metabolically expensive organs in the body. The results show that the increase in brain size in humans is balanced by an equivalent reduction in the size of the gastro-intestinal tract. In other words, the increased energetic demands of a relatively large brain are balanced by the reduced energy demands of a relatively small gastro-intestinal tract. This relationship also seems to be true in non-human primates. The size of the gastro-intestinal tract is dependent on both body size and the quality of the diet. It is argued that humans (and other primates) could not have developed a relatively large brain without also adopting a high quality diet that would have permitted a reduction in the relative size of the gastro-intestinal tract. Dietary change is therefore viewed as a 'prime releaser' in brain evolution. It is argued that a high quality diet is necessary for the evolution of a relatively large brain. However, the change to such a high quality diet, which involved an increased proportion of animal based products, need not have been one of the 'prime movers' in brain evolution. In this context, and based on the archaeological and palaeoanthropological record, the factors most probably surrounding the evolution of the human brain are discussed.},

Our study confirms previous findings that faunal δ13C values in C3 ecosystems are most strongly correlated with variables related to precipitation. δ13Cenamel values for ungulate browsers are more strongly correlated with a larger number of environmental variables than values for grazers and mixed feeders and vary according to vegetation type. We apply regressions derived from the modern dataset to estimate palaeoclimatic shifts based on δ13Cenamel values of browsing fauna at the Pleistocene sites of Hoedjiespunt and Elandsfontein in South Africa.},

	abstract = {The Early Pleistocene was a critical time period in the evolution of eastern African mammal faunas, but fossil assemblages sampling this interval are poorly known from Ethiopia’s Afar Depression. Field work by the Hadar Research Project in the Busidima Formation exposures ({\textasciitilde}2.7–0.8 Ma) of Hadar in the lower Awash Valley, resulted in the recovery of an early
              Homo
              maxilla (A.L. 666-1) with associated stone tools and fauna from the Maka’amitalu basin in the 1990s. These assemblages are dated to {\textasciitilde}2.35 Ma by the Bouroukie Tuff 3 (BKT-3). Continued work by the Hadar Research Project over the last two decades has greatly expanded the faunal collection. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of the Maka’amitalu large mammals (Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Primates, and Proboscidea) and discuss their paleoecological and biochronological significance. The size of the Maka’amitalu assemblage is small compared to those from the Hadar Formation (3.45–2.95 Ma) and Ledi-Geraru (2.8–2.6 Ma) but includes at least 20 taxa. Bovids, suids, and
              Theropithecus
              are common in terms of both species richness and abundance, whereas carnivorans, equids, and megaherbivores are rare. While the taxonomic composition of the Maka’amitalu fauna indicates significant species turnover from the Hadar Formation and Ledi-Geraru deposits, turnover seems to have occurred at a constant rate through time as taxonomic dissimilarity between adjacent fossil assemblages is strongly predicted by their age difference. A similar pattern characterizes functional ecological turnover, with only subtle changes in dietary proportions, body size proportions, and bovid abundances across the composite lower Awash sequence. Biochronological comparisons with other sites in eastern Africa suggest that the taxa recovered from the Maka’amitalu are broadly consistent with the reported age of the BKT-3 tuff. Considering the age of BKT-3 and biochronology, a range of 2.4–1.9 Ma is most likely for the faunal assemblage.},

	abstract = {The behavioral origins of Homo sapiens can be traced back to the first material culture produced by our species in Africa, the Middle Stone Age (MSA). Beyond this broad consensus, the origins, patterns, and causes of behavioral complexity in modern humans remain debated. Here, we consider whether recent findings continue to support popular scenarios of: (1) a modern human ‘package,’ (2) a gradual and ‘pan-African’ emergence of behavioral complexity, and (3) a direct connection to changes in the human brain. Our geographically structured review shows that decades of scientific research have continuously failed to find a discrete threshold for a complete ‘modernity package’ and that the concept is theoretically obsolete. Instead of a continent-wide, gradual accumulation of complex material culture, the record exhibits a predominantly asynchronous presence and duration of many innovations across different regions of Africa. The emerging pattern of behavioral complexity from the MSA conforms to an intricate mosaic characterized by spatially discrete, temporally variable, and historically contingent trajectories. This archaeological record bears no direct relation to a simplistic shift in the human brain but rather reflects similar cognitive capacities that are variably manifested. The interaction of multiple causal factors constitutes the most parsimonious explanation driving the variable expression of complex behaviors, with demographic processes such as population structure, size, and connectivity playing a key role. While much emphasis has been given to innovation and variability in the MSA record, long periods of stasis and a lack of cumulative developments argue further against a strictly gradualistic nature in the record. Instead, we are confronted with humanity's deep, variegated roots in Africa, and a dynamic metapopulation that took many millennia to reach the critical mass capable of producing the ratchet effect commonly used to define contemporary human culture. Finally, we note a weakening link between ‘modern’ human biology and behavior from around 300 ka ago.},

Hunt proposed a model for understanding the potential selective pressures on hominins, made robust, testable predictions based on Au. afarensis functional morphology, and presented a hypothesis that aimed to explain the dual functional signals of the Au. afarensis and, more generally, early hominin postcranium. Here we synthesize what we have learned about Au. afarensis functional morphology and the dual functional signals of two new australopith discoveries with relatively complete skeletons (Australopithecus sediba and StW 573 ‘Australopithecus prometheus’). We follow this with a discussion of three research approaches that have been developed for the purpose of drawing behavioral inferences in early hominins: (1) developments in the study of extant apes as models for understanding hominin origins; (2) novel and continued developments to quantify bipedal gait and locomotor economy in extant primates to infer the locomotor costs from the anatomy of fossil taxa; and (3) novel developments in the study of internal bone structure to extract functional signals from fossil remains. In conclusion of this review, we discuss some of the inherent challenges of the approaches and methodologies adopted to reconstruct the locomotor modes and behavioral repertoires in extinct primate taxa, and notably the assessment of habitual terrestrial bipedalism in early hominins.},

	abstract = {During the middle Pliocene (∼3.8–3.2 Ma), both Australopithecus afarensis and Kenyanthropus platyops are known from the Turkana Basin, but between 3.60 and 3.44 Ma, most hominin fossils are found on the west side of Lake Turkana. Here, we describe a new hominin locality (ET03-166/168, Area 129) from the east side of the lake, in the Lokochot Member of the Koobi Fora Formation (3.60–3.44 Ma). To reconstruct the paleoecology of the locality and its surroundings, we combine information from sedimentology, the relative abundance of associated mammalian fauna, phytoliths, and stable isotopes from plant wax biomarkers, pedogenic carbonates, and fossil tooth enamel. The combined evidence provides a detailed view of the local paleoenvironment occupied by these Pliocene hominins, where a biodiverse community of primates, including hominins, and other mammals inhabited humid, grassy woodlands in a fluvial floodplain setting. Between {\textless}3.596 and 3.44 Ma, increases in woody vegetation were, at times, associated with increases in arid-adapted grasses. This suggests that Pliocene vegetation included woody species that were resilient to periods of prolonged aridity, resembling vegetation structure in the Turkana Basin today, where arid-adapted woody plants are a significant component of the ecosystem. Pedogenic carbonates indicate more woody vegetation than other vegetation proxies, possibly due to differences in temporospatial scale and ecological biases in preservation that should be accounted for in future studies. These new hominin fossils and associated multiproxy paleoenvironmental indicators from a single locale through time suggest that early hominin species occupied a wide range of habitats, possibly including wetlands within semiarid landscapes. Local-scale paleoecological evidence from East Turkana supports regional evidence that middle Pliocene eastern Africa may have experienced large-scale, climate-driven periods of aridity. This information extends our understanding of hominin environments beyond the limits of simple wooded, grassy, or mosaic environmental descriptions.},

	abstract = {One outstanding phenotypic character in Homo is its brain evolution. Pagel (Morphology, shape and phylogeny, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2002) performed a phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of cranial capacity (as a surrogate of brain size) in fossil hominins, finding evidence for gradual evolutionary change with accelerating rate. Since Pagel’s pioneering investigation, the hominin fossil record expanded backward in time, new species were added to our family tree, different phylogenetic hypotheses were advanced, and new phylogenetic comparative methods became available. Therefore, we feel it is timely to repeat and expand upon Pagel’s seminal paper by including such material and applying novel methodologies. We fitted several evolutionary models to the endocranial volume (ECV) for 21 fossil hominins (including Pagel’s original analyses) and estimated phylogenetic signal using different approaches, while accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty. We then applied the phylogenetic signal-representation curve to the data to look for non-stationarity (discontinuities, rate shifts, or presence of different evolutionary patterns in different parts of the phylogeny) in brain size evolution. Our analyses show that, in principle, Pagel’s findings are robust to the addition of new data and phylogenetic uncertainty and confirm both the strong phylogenetic signal in brain size and acceleration of ECV evolutionary rates towards the present. However, non-stationarity was also detected in about 11\% of the simulations, with two significant evolutionary discontinuities occurring close to the origin of the H. sapiens lineage (H. sapiens, H. neanderthalensis, H. heidelbergensis and H. antecessor) and along the phyletic line leading to H. floresiensis. This study calls upon further investigation of these important moments in Homo evolution, in order to understand the processes underling each of these shifts in brain size evolutionary regimes.},

Despite many subsequent studies drawing conclusions about the evolutionary implications for the emergence of unique cerebral specializations in Homo sapiens, no re-assessment has occurred using updated methodologies. Methods We reassessed the association between right temporal lobe volume (TLV) and right hemisphere volume (HV) in the anthropoid brain. In a sample compiled de novo by us, T1-weighted in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 11 extant anthropoid species were calculated by-voxel from the MRI and the raw data from RAS Study directly compared to our sample. Phylogenetic Generalized Least-Squares (PGLS) regression and trait-mapping using Blomberg's K (kappa) tested the correlation between HV and TLV accounting for anthropoid phylogeny, while bootstrapped PGLS regressions tested difference in slopes and intercepts between monkey and ape subsamples. Results PGLS regressions indicated statistically significant correlations (r2 {\textless} 0.99; p ≤ 0.0001) between TLV and HV with moderate influence from phylogeny (K ≤ 0.42). Bootstrapped PGLS regression did not show statistically significant differences in slopes between monkeys and apes but did for intercepts. In our sample, human TLV was not larger than expected for anthropoids. Discussion Updated imaging, increased sample size and advanced statistical analyses did not find statistically significant results that modern humans possessed a disproportionately large temporal lobe volume compared to the general anthropoid trend. This has important implications for human and non-human primate brain evolution.},

            Global change and regime shifts of ecosystems are a major concern today. It has been suggested that the end-Cretaceous impact of an asteroid not only caused mass extinction but also involved the transgression of a global tipping point. We demonstrate that the ecological structure of pre- and postextinction assemblages of marine bivalves and gastropods differ far more than expected from usual background fluctuations. In-depth ecological analyses suggest site-specific rather than globally uniform shifts to different dynamic regimes. At more inclusive ecological levels, parallel increases emerge in mobility levels, in species burrowing into the sediment, and in deposit feeders and carnivores.
          , 
            Contemporary biodiversity loss and population declines threaten to push the biosphere toward a tipping point with irreversible effects on ecosystem composition and function. As a potential example of a global-scale regime shift in the geological past, we assessed ecological changes across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction based on molluscan assemblages at four well-studied sites. By contrasting preextinction and postextinction rank abundance and numerical abundance in 19 molluscan modes of life—each defined as a unique combination of mobility level, feeding mode, and position relative to the substrate—we find distinct shifts in ecospace utilization, which significantly exceed predictions from null models. The magnitude of change in functional traits relative to normal temporal fluctuations at far-flung sites indicates that molluscan assemblages shifted to differently structured systems and faunal response was global. The strengths of temporal ecological shifts, however, are mostly within the range of preextinction site-to-site variability, demonstrating that local ecological turnover was similar to geographic variation over a broad latitudinal range. In conjunction with varied site-specific temporal patterns of individual modes of life, these spatial and temporal heterogeneities argue against a concerted phase shift of molluscan assemblages from one well-defined regime to another. At a broader ecological level, by contrast, congruent tendencies emerge and suggest deterministic processes. These patterns comprise the well-known increase of deposit-feeding mollusks in postextinction assemblages and increases in predators and predator-resistant modes of life, i.e., those characterized by elevated mobility and infaunal life habits.},

	abstract = {Holling's (1959) disc equation is the most commonly used model of type—2 functional response. The constant—parameter version of this model makes three assumptions that are seldom likely to be satisfied: (i) attack rate per unit search time per unit prey density is independent of prey density; (ii) handling time is independent of prey density; and (iii) the relative rates of successful and unsuccessful attack are independent of prey density. Optimal foraging theory is used to suggest how each of these components of the predation process might depend on prey density. Explorations of simple models suggest that these types of adaptive variation are often consistent with type—2 responses, but generally result in shapes that differ significantly from the disc equation. The consequence of using a constant—parameter disc equation model when it is inappropriate is limited ability to predict functional responses in altered circumstances, for example, in the presence of a second prey. The potential ability to understand multispecies systems from their subcomponents cannot be assessed unless appropriate models of the functional response are used to describe the component systems; these models are likely to include adaptive behavior.},

This ecological information and its behavioral and evolutionary implications are revealed most directly from the tooth, cut, and percussion marks on bone surfaces generated by hominin and carnivore feeding activities. This paper employs a bootstrap method, a form of random resampling with replacement, to refine published neotaphonomic models that use the assemblage-wide proportions of long bones bearing feeding traces to infer the sequences in which Plio-Pleistocene hominins and carnivores accessed flesh, marrow, and/or grease from carcasses. Results validate the sensitivity of the models for inferring hominin feeding ecology, which have been questioned on grounds shown here to be unfounded. The bootstrapped feeding trace models are applied to the late Pliocene larger mammal fossil assemblage from FLK 22 (Zinjanthropus site), Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. High frequencies of tooth and percussion marking on long bone midshaft fragments from FLK 22 are most consistent with those feeding trace models that simulate hominin scavenging from carcasses defleshed by carnivores, while cut mark data indicate that hominins more often had access to upper forelimb flesh than upper hind limb flesh. Together, the bone surface modification data indicate that hominins typically gained secondary access to partially defleshed carnivore kills, but they also allow for the possibility of some carcasses being processed only by carnivores and only by hominins.},

	abstract = {Successful eradication of invasives is facilitated by early detection and prompt onset of control. However, realizing or verifying that a colonization has occurred is difficult for cryptic species especially at low population densities. Responding to the capture or unconfirmed sighting of a cryptic invasive species, and the associated effort to determine if it indicates an incipient (small, localized) population or merely a lone colonizer, is costly and cannot continue indefinitely. However, insufficient detection effort risks erroneously concluding the species is not present, allowing the population to increase in size and expand its range. Evidence for an incipient population requires detection of ≥1 individual; its absence, on the other hand, must be inferred probabilistically. We use an actual rapid response incident and species-specific detection estimates tied to a known density to calculate the amount of effort (with non-sequential detections) necessary to assert, with a pre-defined confidence, that invasive brown treesnakes are absent from the search area under a wide range of hypothetical population densities. We illustrate that the amount of effort necessary to declare that a species is absent is substantial and increases with decreased individual detection probability, decreased density, and increased level of desired confidence about its absence. Such survey investment would be justified where the cost savings due to early detection are large. Our Poisson-based model application will allow managers to make informed decisions about how long to continue detection efforts, should no additional detections occur, and suggests that effort to do so is significantly higher than previously thought. While our model application informs how long to search to infer absence of an incipient population of brown treesnakes, the approach is sufficiently general to apply to other invasive species if density-dependent detection estimates are known or reliable surrogate estimates are available.},

This region's record is critical for addressing questions about the course of human evolution in Europe because its geographic position lends it a dual role: on one hand, it encompasses a frequently hypothesized dispersal corridor from Africa into Europe for both archaic and early modern humans; on the other, as one of the three Mediterranean peninsulas, it acted as a refugium for plant, animal, and, most likely, human populations during glacial conditions.

            The effects of overdispersion and zero inflation (e.g., poor model fits) can result in misinterpretation in studies using count data. These effects have not been evaluated in paleoecological studies of predation and are further complicated by preservational bias and time averaging. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty from overdispersion and zero inflation in estimates of specimen and predation trace counts. We demonstrate its application using published data on drilling predators and their prey in time-averaged death assemblages from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
            Our results indicate that estimates of predation frequencies are underestimated when zero inflation is not considered, and this effect is likely compounded by removal of individuals and predation traces via preservational bias. Time averaging likely reduces zero inflation via accumulation of rare taxa and events; however, it increases the uncertainty in comparisons between assemblages by introducing variability in sampling effort. That is, there is an analytical cost with time-averaged count data, manifesting as broader confidence regions. Ecological inferences in paleoecology can be strengthened by accounting for the uncertainty inherent to paleoecological count data and the sampling processes by which they are generated.},

            The number of individuals of species varies, but estimating abundance, given incomplete and biased sampling in both contemporary and fossilized communities, is challenging. Here, we describe a new occupancy model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with random effects, in which multispecies occupancy and detection are modeled as a means to estimate relative species abundance and relative population densities. The modeling framework is suited for temporal samples of fossil communities with repeated sampling including multiple species with similar preservation potential. We demonstrate our modeling framework using a fossil community of benthic organisms to estimate relative species abundance dynamics and changing relative population densities of focal species in nine (geological) time intervals over 2.3 Myr. We also explore potential explanatory factors (paleoenvironmental proxies) and temporal autocorrelation that could provide extra information on unsampled time intervals. The modeling framework is applicable across a wide range of questions on species-level dynamics in paleoecological community settings.},

	abstract = {Building useful models of species distributions requires attention to several important issues, one being imperfect detection of species. Data sets of species detections are likely to suffer from false absence records. Depending on the type of survey, false positive records can also be a problem. Disregarding these observation errors may lead to important biases in model estimation as well as overconfidence about precision. The severity of the problem depends on the intensity of these errors and how they correlate with environmental characteristics (e.g. where species detectability strongly depends on habitat features). A powerful modelling framework that accounts for imperfect detection in the modelling of species distributions has developed in the last 10–15 yr. Fundamental to this framework is that data must be collected in a way that is informative about the observation process. For instance, such data can be in the form of multiple detection/non-detection records obtained from several visits/observers/detection methods at (at least) some of the sites, or from data on times to detection within a survey visit. The framework can extend to studying species’ range dynamics and the modelling of communities, as well as approaches for analysing data on abundance and multiple occupancy states (rather than binary presence/absence). This paper summarizes these modelling advances, discusses evidence about effects of imperfect detection and the difficulties of working with it, and concludes with the current outlook for future research and application of these methods.},

In 2006, Royle and Dorazio discussed the advantages of using a Bayesian approach in modelling animal abundance and occurrence using a hierarchical N-mixture model. N-mixture models assume replication on sampling sites, an assumption that may be violated when the site is not closed to changes in abundance during the survey period or when nominal replicates are defined spatially. In this paper, we studied the robustness of a Bayesian approach to fitting the N-mixture model for pseudo-replicated count data. Our simulation results showed that the Bayesian estimates for abundance and detection probability are slightly biased when the actual detection probability is small and are sensitive to the presence of extra variability within local sites.},

The resultant expression for the likelihood can be readily computed to a high degree of accuracy and is algebraically tractable. Specifically, the likelihood equations can be simplified to some advantage, the concentrated likelihood in the probability of detection formulated and problematic cases identified. The results are illustrated by means of a simulation study and a real world example. The study is extended to N-mixture models with a negative binomial mixing distribution and results similar to those for the Poisson case obtained. N-mixture models with mixing distributions which accommodate excess zeros and, separately, with a beta-binomial distribution rather than a binomial used to model the intra-site counts are also investigated. However the results for these settings, while computationally attractive, do not provide insight into the nature of the maximum likelihood estimates.},

We explain and exploit the equivalence of N-mixture and multivariate Poisson and negative-binomial models, which provides powerful new approaches for fitting these models. We show that particularly when detection probability and the number of sampling occasions are small, infinite estimates of abundance can arise. We propose a sample covariance as a diagnostic for this event, and demonstrate its good performance in the Poisson case. Infinite estimates may be missed in practice, due to numerical optimization procedures terminating at arbitrarily large values. It is shown that the use of a bound, K, for an infinite summation in the N-mixture likelihood can result in underestimation of abundance, so that default values of K in computer packages should be avoided. Instead we propose a simple automatic way to choose K. The methods are illustrated by analysis of data on Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni.},

Within this framework, we specify models of abundance and detectability of animals at the level of the local populations defined by the sample units. Information at the level of the local population is aggregated by specifying models that describe variation in abundance and detection among sites. We describe likelihood-based and Bayesian methods for estimation and inference under the resulting hierarchical model. We provide two examples of the application of hierarchical models to animal survey data, the first based on removal counts of stream fish and the second based on avian quadrat counts.

Recently, doubts about parameter identifiability have been voiced. I conducted a large-scale screening test with 137 bird data sets from 2,037 sites. I found virtually no identifiability problems for Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) binomial N-mixture models, but negative-binomial (NB) models had problems in 25\% of all data sets. The corresponding multinomial N-mixture models had no problems. Parameter estimates under Poisson and ZIP binomial and multinomial N-mixture models were extremely similar. Identifiability problems became a little more frequent with smaller sample sizes (267 and 50 sites), but were unaffected by whether the models did or did not include covariates. Hence, binomial N-mixture model parameters with Poisson and ZIP mixtures typically appeared identifiable. In contrast, NB mixtures were often unidentifiable, which is worrying since these were often selected by Akaike's information criterion. Identifiability of binomial N-mixture models should always be checked. If problems are found, simpler models, integrated models that combine different observation models or the use of external information via informative priors or penalized likelihoods, may help.},

Here, I simultaneously model the occupancy and detection probability of taxa, teasing apart the zeros in data that reflect true absences and those that imply non-detection of taxa that were actually present in the space and time of interest. Occupancy modeling, an approach first developed in population ecology, can easily incorporate covariates of interest, such as sampling effort and habitat variables. I use a data set of brachiopod taxa from the Paleozoic to illustrate the utility of this approach for paleontological questions. I demonstrate a range of models, including those that allow colonization between time intervals and those that incorporate facies as site covariates. I also suggest how future data collection can be improved so that process- and sampling-oriented approaches such as occupancy modeling can be applied with ease to paleobiological settings to answer important paleoecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {Estimating the abundance or density of animal populations is often a fundamental task in ecological research and species conservation. N-mixture models are widely used to estimate the detection probability of individual organisms that thusly leads to more accurate estimates of a species' true abundance. However, individuals likely vary in their probabilities of being detected. During a survey, heterogeneity (variation) in individual detection probability might arise due to conditions of the surveying process; this form of extrinsic heterogeneity can be accounted for by the use of appropriate covariates in the models. In contrast, intrinsic heterogeneity in the detection probabilities of individuals arises when intraspecific variation in behaviour results in individual organisms differing in their latent (inherent) probabilities of being detected. This form of heterogeneity is not tractable by the use of covariates and its possible effects on model performance have not been investigated to date. Using simulated data, we evaluated the performance of Poisson, negative binomial and zero-inflated Poisson versions of N-mixture models under the conditions of intrinsic heterogeneity in individual detection probability. Most versions of N-mixture models performed well in estimating abundance as indicated by relatively low root-mean-square-error values (RMSE {\textless} 1). Error distributions indicated a lack of substantial bias and relatively high precision and accuracy when simulated detection probabilities of individuals were high ({\textgreater}0·5) and heterogeneity was random. Otherwise, with structured heterogeneity (particularly positive density dependence) and low detection probabilities ({\textless}0·5), model performance was reduced (RMSE {\textgreater} 2). The poorest performing model was the zero-inflated Poisson version of N-mixture model applied to data from low survey effort. Our results suggest that N-mixture models are robust to intrinsic heterogeneity in individual detection probabilities except when the detection probabilities are low. When model-estimated detection probabilities are low ({\textless}0·5), model users should be aware that estimates of abundance could be erroneous if there was non-random intrinsic heterogeneity in individual detection probabilities during the surveys. Remedying this situation might require redesigning the basic survey protocol such that it does not rely on behavioural traits (as cues to detection) that are intrinsically variable among individuals.},

	abstract = {Monitoring animal populations is central to wildlife and fisheries management, and the use of N-mixture models toward these efforts has markedly increased in recent years. Nevertheless, relatively little work has evaluated estimator performance when basic assumptions are violated. Moreover, diagnostics to identify when bias in parameter estimates from N-mixture models is likely is largely unexplored. We simulated count data sets using 837 combinations of detection probability, number of sample units, number of survey occasions, and type and extent of heterogeneity in abundance or detectability. We fit Poisson N-mixture models to these data, quantified the bias associated with each combination, and evaluated if the parametric bootstrap goodness-of-fit (GOF) test can be used to indicate bias in parameter estimates. We also explored if assumption violations can be diagnosed prior to fitting N-mixture models. In doing so, we propose a new model diagnostic, which we term the quasi-coefficient of variation (QCV). N-mixture models performed well when assumptions were met and detection probabilities were moderate (i.e., ≥0.3), and the performance of the estimator improved with increasing survey occasions and sample units. However, the magnitude of bias in estimated mean abundance with even slight amounts of unmodeled heterogeneity was substantial. The parametric bootstrap GOF test did not perform well as a diagnostic for bias in parameter estimates when detectability and sample sizes were low. The results indicate the QCV is useful to diagnose potential bias and that potential bias associated with unidirectional trends in abundance or detectability can be diagnosed using Poisson regression. This study represents the most thorough assessment to date of assumption violations and diagnostics when fitting N-mixture models using the most commonly implemented error distribution. Unbiased estimates of population state variables are needed to properly inform management decision making. Therefore, we also discuss alternative approaches to yield unbiased estimates of population state variables using similar data types, and we stress that there is no substitute for an effective sample design that is grounded upon well-defined management objectives.},

We used camera trap records of dhole Cuon alpinus, a group-living species, from three national parks in Thailand as a case study in which we develop integrated likelihood models to estimate abundance incorporating two different data sets, count data and detection/non-detection data. We further investigated relative biases of the models using different proportions of data with lower versus higher quality and assessed parameter identifiability. The simulations indicated that the relative bias on average across 24 tested scenarios was 2\% with a 95\% chance that the simulated data sets obtained the true animal abundances. We found that bias was high ({\textgreater}10\%) when sampling 60 sites with only 5 sampling occasions. We tested four additional scenarios with varying proportions of count data. Our model tolerated the use of relatively low proportions of the higher quality count data, but below 10\% the results began to show bias ({\textgreater}6\%). Data cloning indicated that the parameters were identifiable with all posterior variances shrinking to near zero. Our model demonstrates the benefits of combining data from multiple studies even with different data types. Furthermore, the approach is not limited to camera trap data. Detection/non-detection data from track surveys or counts from transects could also be combined. Particularly, our model is potentially useful for assessing populations of rare species where large amounts of by-catch datasets are available.},

	abstract = {1. Models have been devised previously that allow the estimation of abundance from detection data of unmarked individuals while accounting for imperfect detection, but these are restricted to models for discrete sampling protocols, i.e. replicated detection/non-detection or count data. Furthermore, these models assume that the detections from each individual are independent; however, there are cases in which this assumption is likely to be violated. For example, in surveys along transects, clustering in the signs left by each individual could be expected. 2. Here, we propose models to estimate abundance from species-detection data collected continuously along transects considering two cases: (i) independent detections and (ii) clustering within the detections of each individual. We account for clustering by describing the detection process as a Markov-modulated Poisson process. We study the properties of the estimators via simulation, assessing the impact of unmodelled detection clustering. 3. We show that bias may be induced in the estimator of abundance if clustering in individual detections is not accounted for and how an estimator with better coverage properties is obtained if clustering is modelled. We demonstrate that both abundance and the clustering pattern can be well estimated simultaneously, given enough data. 4. To illustrate our approach, we fit the models to tiger pugmark detection data from transect surveys in Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra. The analysis suggested strong abundance-induced heterogeneity in detections when clustering was disregarded, but the evidence reduced drastically when clustering was accounted for. This example illustrates how unmodelled clustering can affect the estimation of abundance. 5. Estimates of abundance need to be reliable to ensure that conservation and management interventions are not misguided. Provided certain model assumptions are met, abundance can be estimated from detection data of unmarked individuals. This requires an adequate description of the detection process, or otherwise, bias may be induced in the abundance estimator. The models and discussion provided here deal with the issue of clustering within the detections of individuals and are of relevance for ecologists interested in methodological developments for the estimation of animal abundance.},

Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to prior specification. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too ‘subjective’ has prevented many researchers from using any prior information in their analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or not) promotes good statistical practice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how BDA is currently being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of informative priors. We hope to inspire a renewed discussion about the use of Bayesian priors in Ecology with particular attention paid to specification and justification. We also emphasize that all priors are the result of a subjective choice, and should be discussed in that way.},

	abstract = {Binomial N-mixture models are commonly applied to analyse population survey data. By estimating detection probabilities, N-mixture models aim at extracting information about abundances in terms of absolute and not just relative numbers. This separation of detection probability and abundance relies on parametric assumptions about the distribution of individuals among sites and of detections of individuals among repeat visits to sites. Current methods for checking assumptions are limited, and their computational complexity has hindered evaluations of their performance. We use simulations and a case study to assess the sensitivity of binomial N-mixture models to overdispersion in abundance and in detection, develop computationally efficient graphical goodness of fit checks to detect it, and evaluate the ability of the checks to identify overdispersion. The simulations show that if the parametric assumptions are not exact the bias in estimated abundances can be severe: underestimation if there is overdispersion in abundance relative to the fitted model and overestimation if there is overdispersion in detection. Our goodness-of-fit checks performed well in detecting lack of fit when the abundance distribution was overdispersed, but struggled to detect lack of fit when detections were overdispersed. We show that the inability to detect lack of fit due to overdispersed detection is caused by a fundamental similarity between N-mixture models with beta-binomial detections and N-mixture models with negative binomial abundances. The strong biases that can occur in the binomial N-mixture model when the distribution of individuals among sites, or the detection model, is mis-specified implies that checking goodness of fit is essential for sound inference about abundance. To check the assumptions we provide computationally efficient goodness of fit checks that are available in an R-package nmixgof. However, even when a binomial N-mixture model appears to fit the data well, estimates are not robust in the presence of overdispersion. We show that problems can occur even when estimated detection probabilities are high, and that previously reported problems with negative binomial models cannot always be diagnosed by checking the sensitivity of abundance estimates to numerical cutoff values used in likelihood computations.},

Similarly, the association between occupancy (or probability of occurrence) and abundance is also usually assumed to be positive and in most cases constant. Examples of AORs for nomadic species with variable distributions are extremely rare. Here we examined temporal and spatial trends in the AOR over 7 years for a critically endangered nomadic migrant that relies on dynamic pulses in food availability to breed. We predicted a negative temporal relationship, where local mean abundances increase when the number of occupied sites decreases, and a positive relationship between local abundances and the probability of occurrence. We also predicted that these patterns are largely attributable to spatiotemporal variation in food abundance. The temporal AOR was significantly negative, and annual food availability was significantly positively correlated with the number of occupied sites but negatively correlated with abundance. Thus, as food availability decreased, local densities of birds increased, and vice versa. The abundance–probability of occurrence relationship was positive and nonlinear but varied between years due to differing degrees of spatial aggregation caused by changing food availability. Importantly, high abundance (or occupancy) did not necessarily equate to high-quality habitat and may be indicative of resource bottlenecks or exposure to other processes affecting vital rates. Our results provide a rare empirical example that highlights the complexity of AORs for species that target aggregated food resources in dynamic environments.},

However, most empirical studies evaluate the influence of either local environmental variables or regional enrichment but not both simultaneously. Here we demonstrate the importance of combining these processes to understand continental‐scale richness patterns in breeding birds. We show that neither regional enrichment nor the local environment in isolation is sufficient to characterize observed patterns of species richness. Combining both sets of variables into a single model results in improved model fit and the removal of residual spatial autocorrelation. At short timescales, local processes are most important for determining local richness, but as the timescale of analysis increases, regional enrichment becomes increasingly important. These results emphasize the need for increased integration of multiple scales of processes into models of species richness.},

	abstract = {Given a resource gradient (e.g. light intensity, prey size) in a community, species evolve to use different parts of this gradient; competition between them is thereby reduced. Species relationships in the community may be conceived in terms of a multidimensional coordinate system, the axes of which are the various resource gradients (and other aspects of species relationships to space, time, and one another in the community). This coordinate system defines a hyperspace, and the range of the space that a given species occupies is its niche hypervolume, as an abstract characterization of its intra-community position, or niche. Species evolve toward difference in niche, and consequently toward difference in location of their hypervolumes in the niche hyperspace. Through evolutionary time additional species can fit into the community in niche hypervolumes different from those of other species, and the niche hyperspace can become increasingly complex. Its complexity relates to the community's richness in species, its alpha diversity. Species differ in the proportions of the niche hyperspace they are able to occupy and the share of the community's resources they utilize. The share of resources utilized is expressed in species' productivities, and when species are ranked by relative productivity (or some other measurement) from most to least important, importance-value or dominance-diversity curves are formed. Three types of curves may represent manners in which resources are divided among species: (a) niche pre-emption with strong dominance, expressed in a geometric series, (b) random boundaries between niches, expressed in the MacArthur distribution, and (c) determination of relative importance by many factors, so that species form a frequency distribution on a logarithmic base of importance values, a lognormal distribution. The forms of importance-value curves do not permit strong inference about resource division, but are of interest for their expression of species relationships and bearing on measurement of diversity. Two aspects of alpha diversity are to be measured. Diversity in the strict sense is richness in species, and is appropriately measured as the number of species in a sample of standard size. Slope measurements, in contrast, express the steepness of the importance-value sequence. Of the slope measurements the Simpson index expresses dominance or relative concentration of the importance values into the first or first few species, whereas the Shannon-Wiener index expresses the relative evenness or equitability of the importance values through the whole sequence. A new index, expressing equitability as number of species per logarithmic cycle of the importance-value sequence, is suggested. Given a habitat gradient (e.g. elevation or soil moisture conditions) species evolve to occupy different positions along this gradient. The various habitat gradients of a landscape may also be conceived as a multidimensional hyperspace, and species evolve toward occupation of different positions in this hyperspace. Along a particular habitat gradient species populations have scattered centers and usually overlap broadly, forming a community continuum or coenocline. Through evolutionary time additional species can fit themselves in along the coenocline. As they do so the extent of change in community composition along the gradient increases. The extent of differentiation of communities along habitat gradients is beta diversity. The total or gamma diversity of a landscape, or geographic area, is a product of the alpha diversity of its communities and the degree of beta differentiation among them. The species' position in a landscape of communities, as described in terms of both habitat and niche relationships, may be termed its ecotope. Two approaches to measuring beta diversity have been most useful. For a transect along a given coenocline, the degree of species turnover or compositional change may be measured through sample similarities and expressed as half-changes. When a set of samples are taken to represent differences in communities of a landscape or range of habitat along more than one habitat axis, beta differentiation for these samples may be expressed by the ratio of the total number of species represented in the samples to the mean number per sample. Diversity of communities seems a resultant of non-extreme conditions, stable conditions, evolutionary and successional time, and the kind of community developed in that time. It is difficult to separate the effects of chronic environmental rigor, amplitude of regular fluctuation, and irregularity or unpredictableness of fluctuation. Diversities are low in many unstable environments, but certain desert communities subject to wide and irregular variation in precipitation have evolved high diversities in relation to this variation. Evolutionary time is difficult to measure, but is important as the dimension through which increase in alpha and beta diversity occurs. Alpha diversities of birds, and gamma diverstities of islands, appear to reach saturation or steady-state levels. It is suggested, however, that for terrestrial plants and insects increase of species diversity, with elaboration of the niche hyperspace and division of the habitat hyperspace, is a self-augmenting evolutionary process without any evident limit.},

Similarity of bird species composition is not related to similarity of foilage distribution, when like study areas are compared. Avifaunas of grasslands generally differed more among themselves than did those of forests. Bird species overlaps were correlated with foilage height overlaps only for part of the variational range for two- and three-layered habitats, and little if at all for grasslands.

	abstract = {The distribution of relative abundances between the species of a plant community has been remarkably little analysed. We examine differences in relative abundance distribution (RAD) between different soil fertility levels, and trends through time in the development of a community, using data from three grassland experiments: Monks Wood grassland restoration, Park Grass long-term fertilizer trial and Compton grassland restoration. 2 Comparing plots with different fertilizer treatments, the evenness of plant species abundance was higher where phosphorus had been applied; other effects of soil fertility on evenness were inconsistent. There were no consistent effects of soil fertility on the relative fit of the Geometric, General Log-normal and Zipf-Mandelbrot models of RAD, contrary to previous theories. However, the Broken Stick model fitted relatively better, though still poorly in absolute terms, in plots with high species richness and where phosphorus had been applied. Parameter \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ of the General Log-normal distribution was higher in the high-nitrogen and species-poor plots, disproving the theory that \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ should be constant. Parameter \${\textbackslash}beta\$ of the Zipf-Mandelbrot model was higher in more species-rich and in high-phosphorus plots, a result not predicted in the literature. The variation in \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ seems to be largely a reflection of the variation in evenness and in species dominance. The consistency in species dominance across space (rank consistency) was higher in plots with phosphorus addition. It is concluded that resource availability had little effect on which model of community assembly fitted. However, under high phosphorus conditions the community was more spatially consistent, and there was less dominance. 3 Through time, the evenness of species abundances increased, consistently between two separate experiments. Examining the shape of the abundance distribution at a more detailed level, there were no time trends in which relative abundance model fitted best, except that the fit of the Broken Stick model became less poor. However, the shape of the General Log-normal and Zipf-Mandelbrot curves, as seen in indices \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$, respectively, changed through time, consistently between two separate experiments, supporting the implication from increased evenness of increasing niche diversification. Rank consistency increased in the early years of succession, then decreased, supporting the Three-phase succession model of Gitay \& Wilson (1995), in which a middle `building' phase has higher rank consistency than the preceding `pioneer' phase or the succeeding `mature' phase.},

This theory, species-energy theory, extends beyond species-area theory in that it applies to islands that differ in their per-unit-area productivity due to differences in physical environment, such as climate. Examination of data on species number of angiosperms and of land and freshwater birds on islands worldwide, ranging from Greenland and Spitsbergen to New Guinea and Jamaica, demonstrates that species-energy theory can explain 70 to 80\% of the variation in species number on such widely varying islands, and further suggests the existence of regular geographic trends in resource utilization or species-abundance patterns. The concepts embodied in species-energy theory can in principle be used to develop predictions of species' abundances and probabilities of occurrence on an island. Species-energy theory may also provide a unified basis for understanding a broad set of observations of patterns in species diversity. /// Более общая биогеографическая теория числа островных видов создана путем репликации территории, где проводились прямые измерения использования энергии к моделям Мак артура и Уилсона и Пристона.

Theory suggests, however, that these same priority effects make it difficult for species to coexist in the region unless individuals are continuously supplied from an external species pool, often an unrealistic assumption. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary hypothesis to solve this conundrum. We build a metacommunity model in which local priority effects occur between two species via interspecific interference. Within each species there are two genotypes: one is more resistant to interspecific interference than the other but pays a fitness cost for its resistance. Because of this trade-off, species evolve to become less resistant as they become regionally more common. Rare species can then invade some local patches and consequently recover in regional frequency. This “eco-evolutionary buffering” enables the regional coexistence of species despite local priority effects, even in the absence of immigration from an external species pool. Our model predicts that eco-evolutionary buffering is particularly effective when local communities are small and connected by infrequent dispersal.},

	abstract = {The power function model S = CAz of the species—area relation has a number of shortcomings: it is unbounded, is unable to deal with islands with zero species, and is inappropriate to the known sampling distribution of S. Using only the null assumption that species are randomly allocated to areas, I propose an extreme—value function (EVF) model of the species—area relation derived from Coleman's theory of random placement. This model accords with empirical and theoretical results that have called into question the accuracy of the power function model at large areas, and resolves two dilemmas in the power function model: the lack of any bound to species number, and heteroscedasticity in the sampling distribution of species number. The model is also able to deal with islands with zero species, without modification. The EVF is comparable to the power function model over most practical ranges of island sizes, but has properties that make it superior to the power function model. The EVF model also provides a logical synthesis of single—species incidence and multiple—species models, and as a model of single—species incidence has parameters with biological meaning.},

	abstract = {In order to facilitate experiments on colonization, a technique was developed that permits the removal of the faunas of very small islands. The islands are covered by a tent and fumigated with methyl bromide at concentrations that are lethal to arthropods but not to the plants. Seven islands in Florida Bay, of varying distance and direction from immigrant sources, were censused exhaustively. The small size (diameter 11-18 m) and ecological simplicity of these islands, which consist solely of red mangrove trees (Rhizophora mangle) with no supratidal ground, allowed the location and identification of all resident species. The terrestrial fauna of these islands is composed almost exclusively of arboreal arthropods, with 20-50 species usually present at any given moment. Surveys of these taxa throughout the Florida Keys, with emphasis on the inhabitants of mangrove forests, were made during 1967 in order to estimate the size and composition of the @'species pool.@' The seven experimental islands were defaunated in late 1966 and early 1967, and the colonists were monitored for 17-20 man-hours every 18 days. Precautions were taken to avoid artificial introductions during the monitoring periods.},

	abstract = {Wildlife surveys often seek to determine the presence or absence of species at sites. Such data may be used in population monitoring, impact assessment, and species– habitat analyses. An implicit assumption of presence/absence surveys is that if a species is not detected in one or more visits to a site, it is absent from that site. However, it is rarely if ever possible to be completely sure that a species is absent, and false negative observation errors may arise when detection probabilities are less than 1. The detectability of species in wildlife surveys is one of the most important sources of uncertainty in determining the proportion of a landscape that is occupied by a species. Recent studies emphasize the need to acknowledge and incorporate false negative observation error rates in the analysis of site occupancy data, although a comparative study of the range of available methods for estimating detectability and occupancy is notably absent. The motivation for this study stems from the lack of guidance in the literature about the relative merits of alternative methods for estimating detection probabilities and site occupancy proportions from presence/absence survey data. Six approaches to estimating underlying detection probabilities and the proportion of sites occupied from binary observation data are reviewed. These include three parametric methods based on binomial mixtures, one nonparametric approach based on mark–recapture theory, and two approaches based on simplistic assumptions about occupancy rates. We compare the performance of each method using simulated data for which the “true” underlying detection rate is known. Simulated data were realized from a beta-binomial distribution, incorporating a realistic level of variation in detection rates. Estimation methods varied in their precision and bias. The “binomial-with-added-zeros” mixture model, estimated by maximum likelihood, was the least biased estimator of detection probability and, therefore, occupancy rate. We provide an Excel spreadsheet to execute all of the methods reviewed. Stand-alone programs such as PRESENCE may be used to estimate all models including the “binomial with added zeros” model. Our findings lend support to the use of maximum likelihood methods in estimating site occupancy and detectability rates.},
